The tournament successfully completed its 14 years and in this 15th year, the tournament became more special in each and every aspect including the number of teams, games, and competitiveness. The 70-plus day toil of the teams comes to an end today with the top two teams <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Gujarat Titans</strong></span> and <span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Rajasthan Royals</strong></span> surviving in the highly competitive tournament and it all comes to an end today with the ultimate champion being unfurled today. The Rajasthan Royals enter the finals after their first season this time and for the Gujarat Titans, this is their maiden season and final. The match today will be held at Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad. Who will turn victorious in the ultimate battle and will sit on the throne with the trophy? Will the stands with an audience of more than one lakh people echo \"Aave De\" or \"Halla Bol\"?</p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>Both the teams have clashed against each other twice, once in the league stage in which Gujarat Titans won the match by 37 runs and in the qualifier one Gujarat chased down the target in the last over! Will Gujarat beat Rajasthan Royals for one last time this season or will Rajasthan rewrite the history and win in this ultimate match?</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>The stadium hosted the qualifier two match here and it was the team that chased the target won. The first innings total was 158 in the previous game and the fast bowlers of both the teams picked 9 wickets in total and this venue could be ideal for the pacers.</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Simon Doull: \"The bounce is a bit higher here, sticking onto the surface a little bit. Bowlers who can hit the deck hard, bowl that back of a length can cause trouble to the batters, the dimensions are pretty much the same, although one side is slightly shorter. Teams that have batted first have won the final 9 times, win the toss, bat first and put up something around 180-190.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><strong>Rajasthan Royals have won the toss and they elect to bat first!</strong></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Sanju Samson, Rajasthan Royals Captain: </strong></span>\"We will bat first. Looks like a good wicket, a bit dry and that's why we'll bat first, it's a used wicket and might help our spinners in the second innings. We're all positive and excited. Playing in front of this crowd is exciting. The moment we stepped into the ground we felt special. <strong>Same team for us</strong>.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Gujarat Titans Captain:</strong></span> \"We would have bowled first. This is fantastic to see so may people coming to support us. We have the opportunity to be a hero and this is the time for us. We have to approach this game as normal as possible, the boys have been very chilled out and thanks to the support staff for managing that. <strong>We have one change - Lockie Ferguson comes in place of Alzarri Joseph</strong>.\"</p>",

After winning the toss, RR elected to bat first. The openers Y Jaiswal and J Buttler got dismissed for 22 runs and 39 runs respectively and the GT bowlers kept on taking wickets at regular intervals. The skipper H Pandya led the team from the front with the ball as he finished his spell with 3 wickets in four over and by giving just 17 runs. With the target of 131 to chase, GT started off slowly and steadily with S Gill* (45 off 43) holding one end. H Pandya (34 off 30) played his part with the bat too and D Miller in the end made up 32* runs off just 19 deliveries and all these efforts steered the team to the victory by 7 wickets and with 11 balls to spare.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Sanju Samson, Rajasthan Royals Skipper:</strong></span> \"This season was really special for us. Last two-three seasons all the fans, everyone was having a really hard time. Good to give them some happy moments. Really proud of my team. Great youngsters, great senior players. One off day today but really proud of my team.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Hardik Pandya is the Player of the match</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Skipper of Gujarat Titans and Player of the Match:</strong></span> \"Wanted to show at the right time what I've worked hard for. Today was the day from the bowling point of view I saved the best for the best. All about sticking to the right lengths, asking the batters to play the right shots. For me my team is the most important. I've always been that kind of individual. If I were to have a worse season and my team wins, I'll take that. Batting comes first to me, always going to be close to my heart. Count myself lucky winning 5 finals, it's been exciting. This is going to be a special one. We spoke about creating a legacy. Generation to come, everyone will remember this was the team who started this journey and to win the championship first year is very special.\"</p>",

After winning the toss and opting to field first, RR picked the wicket of Virat Kohli within the powerplay and put up the pressure straight away. R Patidar constructed his innings and made 58 runs off 42 balls along with the quick cameo of G Maxwell (24 off 13). P Krishna and O McCoy accounted for three wickets each and restricted the total to 157 runs. RR in the chase started off brilliantly and Jos Buttler carried the innings on his shoulder and escorted the team to the victory by 7 wickets and 11 balls to spare. <strong>Rajasthan Royals will face Gujarat Titans at this same venue on Sunday for the grand finale!</strong></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Faf Du Plessis, Royal Challengers Bangalore Captain:</strong> </span>\"When we walked off the field, we felt were a few short. Felt 180 was a par score on that pitch. First six overs felt like Test cricket. Compared to the other wickets, this one was quicker off the new ball, and then it eased off later in the innings. Great season for RCB. Really proud. My first season coming in and seeing how special the fans are everywhere we go. A big thank you to everyone coming out and supporting us. Obviously disappointed tonight. Came up against a really strong Rajasthan team who probably deserve it more than us. Well done to everyone and thank you very much.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Sanju Samson, Rajasthan Royals Captain:</strong></span> \"It was tough after a loss in the last game, but we are used to bouncing back in the tournament. In IPL it's very normal that you go ups and downs throughout the tournament. We lost a few games, we knew how to come back and we did really well. The wicket was a bit sticky and was helping the fast bowlers a bit, it had really good bounce and was easier playing the spinners. We closed the innings really well, having DK and Maxi at the end we knew what they could do but having belief and composure in our skills is what got us through. Very grateful to have someone like Jos, and the way he is batting, touchwood, we have one more game to go.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Jos Buttler is the player of the match&nbsp;</strong></p><div>Jos Buttler: \"I came to the season with very low expectations but a lot of energy. It is very exciting to stand in the final. I had a season of two halves, and had very honest conversations with people really close to me. I was feeling the pressure midway, and it was only about a week ago that I opened up about it. Sometimes it is not working for me, and there are times when a younger me would have played a shot and come out. But it's something that Sanga has been saying that the longer you stay, you give yourselves a chance to find a way. Great excitement to have the opportunity to play in the final of the biggest tournament in T20 cricket.\"</div>",

The newbies LSG displayed an astounding brand of cricket in their maiden season and they became the second team to seal the spot in the playoffs. Their opponents for tonight, RCB set foot into the playoffs with the courtesy of Mumbai Indians defeating Delhi Capitals in their last game. Both the teams are in positive momentum after a victory in their previous match and the winner of this fixture will enter the Qualifier two and play against Rajasthan Royals. Will it be a Red rage tonight or will it be LSG who will finish high?</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>The Qualifier match number one that took place here witnessed 379 runs yesterday and the team which chased the target won the match.&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>In the only time these two teams met, RCB batted first and put up a total of 181 runs and LSG fell short of 18 runs in the chase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Graeme Smith:</strong>&nbsp;\"A bit two-paced, the ball skids along and gets a little better to bat on. It's the same pitch that was used yesterday. Looks a perfect pitch for a matchup again, doesn't look like 40 overs were played here yesterday. The average score here since 2019 is 183 and the outfield is quick and pristine.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><strong>Lucknow Super Giants won the toss and decided to bowl first!</strong></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>KL Rahul, Lucknow Super Giants Skipper:</strong></span> \"We will bowl first. Looks like a good wicket, we want to know what we are chasing. Hopefully we will get some swing and take few early wickets. <strong>Gowtham and Jason miss out, Krunal and Chameera come in.</strong> It is always good if the top three set up the game for your team. Hooda has playing well, and the other guys are looking forward to do well.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Faf du Plessis, Royal Challengers Bangalore Skipper:</strong></span> \"We were unsure of what to do. It's a used wicket, but it looks a decent batting wicket. This ground is pretty small, so you can catch up towards the end. <strong>Siraj is back in the team.</strong> We have got some good players in the team, who thrive for this occasion.

After winning the toss and electing to field first, LSG picked the skipper of RCB for a duck. The sole innings from Rajat Patidar (112* off 54) in the middle boosted the score and Dinesh Karthik (37* off 23) in the end did his part very well as a finisher and the total was 207!

The guys put in a special performance. Over the moon. For a young guy (Rajat Patidar) to play like he did. His hundred was one of the best I have seen in the IPL. Our bowlers were clear and calm and that was good. We were very happy as a group. As a group we needed some calm presence. We didn't feel like it was a big game. Every one was calm and relaxed. Harshal bowls the important overs.

It has been an amazing start for the fresh team Gujarat Titans as they finish the league stage with ten wins and finished on top of the table. Their opponents Rajasthan Royals displayed a consistent brand of cricket and ended their league stage by finishing number two in the table. The winner of today's match will directly qualify for the finals and the team which loses will get another chance to enter the final through qualifier two! Will Gujarat Titans step into the finals on their maiden season or will Rajasthan get in for the first time after the inaugral season?</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>In the last four International T20 games played at this venue, it was the teams that batted first won three games. The average first innings score in those games was 178/6 with three 180 plus scores! This venue also holds the record of second highest sixes since 2018 IPL!</p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>The two teams have faired off against each other once and GT won that match by 37 runs!</p><div> </div><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Matthew Hayden: \"It's got lots of grass cover and that means the quicks will be in play. I don't think there's going to be a lot of turn. Not much of wear and tear.

Looks a decent track to bat on, and just want to know what we are chasing. Boys are pretty pumped up for this game. We treat this game as simple as possible and make sure you focus on what is controllable and making sure the intensity is high and aware of what the situation demands.

I genuinely see even the players in the dugout are trying and praying for them to make sure they do well. That is something fantastic and that is the reason we have reached where we have reached. It's all about making sure we respect this game. I'm proud of Miller for the way he has played. Wherever my team requires me to play, I don't generally demand where I want to bat. That's not how I've got success.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>David Miller is the player of the match&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>David Miller:</strong> \"I've been given a role, I felt extremely backed from the outset.

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of Match 69 in the TATA IPL where the Mumbai Indians battle against the Delhi Capitals at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. After 68 matches filled with ebbs and flows, there are still two teams fighting for the last playoff spot, and a team with all to lose goes up against a team that has nothing to lose. The Delhi Capitals are currently placed fifth in the points table, and their fate lies in their own hands, needing a win tonight to move them to the 4th spot, courtesy of a better NRR than the Royal Challengers Bangalore. On the other hand, RCB will be wearing blue tonight for a change, hoping that Mumbai van get the better of Delhi and help them stay in the Top 4. The Delhi Capitals have peaked at the right moment having won their last two matches, whereas Mumbai themselves have had a season to forget and will look finish on a high on their home turf.</p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD</strong>:-</p><p>Mumbai Indians edge the Delhi Capitals in the head to head, winning 16 of the 31 games between the two sides. When the two sides met earlier this season, in what was their first matches of the season, Axar Patel and Lalit Yadav took Delhi home in the chase, as they won by 4 wickets.</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS</strong>:-</p><p>Three of the last four games at the venue have been won by the chasing teams. Mumbai have won once and lost twice at this venue whereas Delhi have also won once but lost thrice.</p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings score in each phase at night matches in the venue:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov):- 41/2</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov):- 71/2</p><p>Death Overs (16-20 Ov):- 54/2</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Danny Morrison: \"This is the middle pitch so the boundary is even on both sides. Love the red soil to pieces because it does offer bounce. Spinners do love it here. Little bit of live grass on it, but it's about getting the lengths right. Pace bowlers in particular have been bowling Test match lengths to get people out. Let's watch out for couple of wrist spinners tonight.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><strong>Mumbai Indians have won the toss and will field first.</strong></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Mumbai Indians Captain:</strong></span> \"We are going to bowl first. Good track. Wanted to have a score in front of us. Crucial for us that we restrict them and then bat freely. We were inconsistent throughout the season. There will be a few eyes on us, so we got to come up with the best. We have tried a few things in the last few games keeping an eye on the future. We want to finish on a high. <strong>Two changes - Brevis back in for Stubbs. Shokeen in place of Sanjay, who is injured.\"</strong></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Rishabh Pant, Delhi Capitals Captain: </strong></span><strong>\"</strong>We wanted to bowl first.

Bumrah was the highest wicket-taker with 3 wickets for 25 runs. In the chase, Ishan Kishan (48 off 35) started well and Dewald Brevis (37 off 33) continued the momentum.

On occasions, we let the game slip away from our grabs when we were on top. That's what we were doing throughout the season. Not good enough to win this match I guess. We could have done better execution and planning. Learn from mistakes and come back stronger next year. We were 5-7 runs short but we bowled really well. It's hard but we got to take it on our chin and learn from it.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Mumbai Indians Skipper:</strong></span> \"We were here to win the game. I know few teams were watching us closely, but we wanted to finish on a high. We'll try to correct the mistakes next season. It was tough after losing eight games, so we needed to rectify the mistakes. But I think we performed well in the second half of the season. When they got to 160 I was nervous, because it was a sluggish pitch. We didn't get off to a good start, but that partnership put us in a good position. We came to the party a bit too late, but at least we can take a few positives from this tournament.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Jasprit Bumrah is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p>Jasprit Bumrah: \"Nothing special, just tried to have fun, and enjoyed my game.&nbsp; Very happy with how the last game went. The wicket is quite fast here, there's pace and bounce. But this was slow, and the bounce was low. There wasn't much swing, so we assessed the conditions and tried to execute our plans.\"</p>",

Rajasthan will look to book their spot in the Top 2 with a win tonight whereas Chennai and Dhoni would look to finish their campaign with a victory.</p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>CSK has won 15 of the 25 encounters between these two sides but since 2018 both sides have won four games each.</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>This is the final match at Brabourne this season and both teams have had contrasting results at the venue so far, with Rajasthan winning both their previous matches here and Chennai losing both. The stadium has also been the best venue for batting this year with the average 1st innings score being 179. The ground has also favoured the spinners the best, with 69 wickets being returned to them. In night matches at this venue this month, the batting first team has won all the games. Will we see that continue tonight?</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-</strong></p><p>Matthew Hayden: \"This is a glorious ground. We've got the bigger pockets all-round the ground and there is a glorious breeze blowing across. Over 5000 runs have been scored at this venue, and 200 have been breached seven times. It looks quite hard and doesn't have that usual grass covering we have been used to seeing. Seems a high-scoring surface and whoever wins the toss will want to bat. And they'll want to get to that 190 score because this is a belter.\".</p><p> </p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><strong>Chennai Super Kings have won the toss and will bat first.</strong></p><p><br /><strong>From definitely not to definitely yes the legacy of MS Dhoni continues!</strong><br /> </p><p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>MS Dhoni, Chennai Super Kings Captain:</strong></span><strong> </strong>\"We'll bat first. You want to give batters enough time, given our combination. Just want them to express themselves. <strong>Only one change - Rayudu in for Shivam.</strong> Want to groom players but also give them enough opportunity to develop. <strong>Definitely will play next year</strong>, because it will be unfair not to say thank you to Chennai. Won't be nice to do that to CSK fans.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Sanju Samson, Rajasthan Royals Captain:</strong></span> \"We're comfortable doing both but would have wanted to bat first. <strong>One change - Hetmyer comes in for Neesham.</strong> We've been playing some good cricket and want to finish off on a high.\"</p>",

In the chase, Yashasvi Jaiswal steered the innings from the top, scoring 59(44), after which Ashwin provided the finishing touches with a quickfire 40* (23) to take the Royals across the finish line.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>MS Dhoni, Chennai Super Kings Captain:</strong></span> \"I think what we need to understand is that we were playing a batter light. So when we lost those wickets, Moeen had to curb himself a bit. Role and responsibility got swapped a bit when the wickets fell. If we had lost another wicket at that point, we wouldn't have even got anything to defend. I'd say 10-15 runs short although the start is always crucial. If you don't start well, even 180 may not be enough. We have done well in patches but important thing is to do well as a team. It's not a one-year tournament, you keep coming back year after year. The key is to keep going as a player for the next 10-12 years.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Sanju Samson, Rajasthan Royals Captain:</strong></span> \"Feels really good, it has been standout, almost everyone has stood out for us.

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of Match 67 in the TATA IPL 2023 where the Royal Challengers Bangalore take on the Gujarat Titans at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. The last time these two sides clashed, Virat Kohli brought up a half-century but Rahul Tewatia and David Miller chased down the score and helped Gujarat win by 4 wickets. It is a must-win game for the Bangalore-based franchise whereas Gujarat are not only through to the playoffs but have also confirmed a spot in the top two. The match has repercussions far beyond the two teams part of this contest, as a win for RCB tonight will eliminate both the Sunrisers and Punjab Kings.</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>This venue has hosted 18 matches of which both the teams batting 1st and the teams chasing have won nine each. However, in the last 5 games, the chasing side has won 4. Both teams have won all their matches at this ground this year. <strong>Who will remain unbeaten tonight?</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings score in each phase at night matches in the venue:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov):- 41/2</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov):- 70/2</p><p>Death Overs (16-20 Ov):- 54/2</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-</strong></p><p><strong>Graeme Smith:</strong> \"19th game at the Wankhede and usually at this time of the tournament, you expect the pitch to be dry, but today's pitch is probably the hardest I have seen at the Wankhede in this tournament. It looks good to me, nice grass covering, it should hold the pitch. I expect this to help the batters tonight. In general, we have seen batters take time in the first 10 overs, and it is a ground you can take advantage of at the end.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><strong>Gujarat Titans have won the toss and will bat first.</strong></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Gujarat Titans Skipper:</strong></span> \"We are going to bat. The kind of situation we are in, we thought we can practice batting first and putting a good score on the board. <strong>One change, Lockie comes in place of Alzarri.</strong> Looks like a similar wicket to the one we played against Chennai, but I expect this to play better as this is an evening game.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Faf du Plessis, Royal Challengers Bangalore Skipper:</strong></span> \"We would have batted too. Looks a bit dry. <strong>One change. Sid Kaul comes in for Siraj.</strong> We have to win today and Delhi needs to lose their game. Games like today bring out characters\"</p>",

In the chase, Bangalore was off to the perfect start with Virat Kohli scoring a half-century and putting on a 100-run partnership for the opening wicket with Faf du Plessis, their first of the tournament, after which Maxwell provided the finishing touches to take Royal Challengers Bangalore home with 8 balls to spare. <strong>As part of the result achieved tonight the Sunrisers Hyderabad and Punjab Kings are out of the playoff race.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Hardik Pandya, Gujarat Titans Skipper:</span> </strong>\"We had just a par score. The ball was stopping here and there and we were happy with 168. We wanted to give Lockie the opportunity but the wicket was holding a bit, so we wanted to go for bowlers who bowled slower ones and took pace off the ball. We pulled things back in the middle but the way Maxwell played in the end made us feel we were 10 runs short. We are on the right track and we just need to look after losing back-to-back wickets. The way the boys are gelling and the way we are going, it is a learning for the players. I don't know about Saha's injury, he was feeling his hamstring and it was a precautionary measure to keep him off the field.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Faf du Plessis, Royal Challengers Bangalore Skipper:</strong></span> \"Throughout the season we haven't done as much as we have liked. You need to back these big players and Virat had been putting in the hard yards in the nets. I think tonight was important for obvious reasons. You always want to finish strongly. A few inconsistent performances have put us in this situation and I am banking on Rohit to come good day after tomorrow.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Virat Kohli is the Player of the Match.</strong></p><p><strong>Virat Kohli:</strong> \"It was an important game. I was disappointed that I haven't done much for my team and that is what bothers me, today was a game where I was able to create an impact for the team. There are expectations because of the performances that you have put in, you need to keep the perspective right. With the very first shot of Shami, I felt I could hit length balls over the fielder's head and I knew that tonight was the night when I could kick on. It has been wonderful that I have got so much support in this edition. I am forever grateful for all the love.\"</p>",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of Match 66 in the TATA IPL where the Kolkata Knight Riders and Lucknow Super Giants face off in both of their last league game at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai. It is that time of the season when all teams bring out the calculators and previously had an 8-team IPL provided unreal chaos, the 10-team IPL has increased that intensity. While a win would be more than enough for the Lucknow Super Giants to seal a place in the playoffs, a win for the Knight Riders will add considerable spice to the final league stage contests. Both sides come into the contest on contrasting fortunes, with Kolkata winning their last two encounters whereas Lucknow will look to turn things back after two consecutive losses. The last time the two sides met earlier this season, KKR went down to the Lucknow seamers as LSG won by a massive margin of 75 runs.</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>At DY Patil Stadium this year, the Knight Riders have won one and lost two, while the Supergiants have won two and lost one. The last three contests at the venue have been largely low-scoring thrillers. Will we see another one tonight?</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-</strong></p><p><strong>Graeme Swann:</strong> \"It's the 20th and the last game at the DY Patil Stadium this season. Over 6000 runs, nearly 250 wickets, and the ground staff have provided brilliant wickets and an amazing outfield. We are in the middle of the square today - 70m on one side, 73 on the other side. The pitch has got a bit tired, it's very flat, there's even grass coverage and it is still rock hard. It is going to turn and grip for the spinners. The team winning the toss should bat first. If you can get to 155-160 on this pitch, you are in the game.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><strong>Lucknow Super Giants have won the toss and will bat first.</strong></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>KL Rahul, Lucknow Super Giants Skipper:</strong></span> \"We'll bat first. The pitch looks a bit dry. Last few games, it's been tough chasing. We have to be positive, we've done really well in the tournament. We need to start afresh, try to win this game, and enjoy. We do have quality in the middle-order, everyone's experienced, and you trust them to figure it out. We expect them to come back strong and deliver. <strong>We have three changes - Krunal has a niggle, so he sits out. Chameera and Badoni miss out.

After winning the toss and opting to bat, Lucknow was off from the first ball with Quinton de Kock and KL Rahul putting on a 200-run partnership and Quinton de Kock scoring the highest score of this season, to help post 210 on board. In the chase, the Knight Riders were off to a flyer scoring 60 runs in the Powerplay and a half-century from Shreyas Iyer and quickfire contributions from Nitish Rana and Sam Billings in the middle, and fireworks from Rinku Singh and Sunil Narine in the end took the game to the wire, but a spectacular catch from Evin Lewis ensured Lucknow get their 9th win of the campaign as they win by 2 runs.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer, Kolkata Knight Riders Skipper:</strong></span> \"That was one of the best games of cricket I have played. The way we should our character and attitude were simply outstanding. I love the way Rinku got us till the end but unfortunately couldn't time it when two balls were remaining. I was hoping he could finish the game for us but still played a fantastic knock and I am really happy for him. It was a do-or-die situation for us, even after losing two wickets in the powerplay our mindset was to go for the chase and take it close as possible and put them under pressure. It was a volatile season for us, we started great but lost five games in a row and I personally feel we did a lot of chopping and changing, we had to do that because of the niggles and form, but we also got to know the players such as Rinku. The vibe has always been positive in the dressing room and we never hit the panic button.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>KL Rahul, Lucknow Super Giants Skipper:</strong></span> \"Haven't been many games that have gone down to the last ball, maybe some which went to the last over and happy to be on the winning side. Could easily have been on the losing side and have gone back home thinking we lost due to some poor cricket. Good way to finish the last game of the league season. Credit to both teams to make such a brilliant game of cricket. Can't say we held our nerves better because it was a matter of three runs. For Stoinis to execute those plans in the last two balls to get us the win, was brilliant. We started well with the bat. We knew that KKR would come hard at us, credit to them as they kept playing good shots. The only talk during timeouts was to back your best balls. The minute we went away from the plans was when it became easier for the batters. Guys getting 30s and 40s had to get us 80s and 90s, and that's exactly what de Kock did. Good learning for us, wins like these help to keep the team together.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Quinton de Kock is the Player of the Match.</strong></p><p><strong>Quinton de Kock:</strong> \"I was a little bit cooked but it was a matter of getting some refreshments and getting on with it I guess. Felt really good to come out and do well. Obviously, Kolkata played really well, assessed conditions well, and came hard at us. I thought Stoinis would defend it easily, but when the first three went, I thought the game was done for us, but that catch, turned things for us. As they say, good catches win matches.\"</p>",

Mumbai come into the contest on the back of 3 wins in their last 4 games, whereas Sunrisers are on a five-match losing streak and will look to turn things around tonight. Tonight the Hyderabad-based franchise will like to have a last throw of the dice while Mumbai will be motivated to escape the wooden spoon.</p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>The two teams have clashed on 18 occasions in the IPL, with Mumbai Indians winning 10 games when compared to Sunrisers Hyderabad's 8.</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Chasing sides have won six of the last eight matches at the Wankhede Stadium, with both wins for the side batting first coming in day games. At the Wankhede Stadium this season, Mumbai have won once and lost once, while Hyderabad lost both their matches. The seamers have got a lot of help early on as this venue has the best bowling SR for pacers in the powerplay this IPL.</p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings score in each phase at night matches in the venue:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov):- 40/2</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov):- 69/2</p><p>Death Overs (16-20 Ov):- 54/2</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-</strong></p><p><strong>Matthew Hayden:</strong> \"This wicket, as always, looks like a very, very good wicket. There isn't a lot of grass, and whatever little there is, is dry. There are some cracks in it, and it is very dry. Around 180 should be around par. Get runs first up, because it gets difficult through the evening with little dew.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><strong>Mumbai Indians won the toss and elected to field.</strong></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Mumbai Indians Skipper:</strong></span> \"We're going to field first. Just want to try out some things, and it works when we have a score in front of us. <strong>We have two changes: the spinners from the last game go out, and Mayank Markande and Sanjay Yadav come in.</strong> We want to look at certain players with an eye on next year. We have one more game after this, and we can try a few more guys in that game.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Kane Williamson, Sunrisers Hyderabad Skipper:</strong></span> \"We were going to have a bat first. We need to look at the NRR as well. It does look like a dry wicket and putting runs on the board would be good. <strong>Two changes: Priyam Garg comes in for Shashank and Fazal Farooqi comes in for Marco Jansen.</strong> Just tactical changes, things are getting tight and we just need to adjust quickly.\"</p>",

After being put in to bat first, Hyderabad shined throughout the innings with Rahul Tripathi scoring his third half-century of the season, supported by knocks from Garg at the top and Pooran in the middle to help the Sunrisers set Mumbai a target of 194 to chase. In the chase, Mumbai got off to the perfect start with their openers putting on 95-runs for the first wicket, after which Umran Malik struck thrice to pull back the game for Sunrisers. With 45 needed from the last three overs, Tim David smacked four maximums in the 18th Over to bring the equation down to 19 from 12 balls, but a wicket maiden from Bhuvneshwar Kumar in the 19th Over ensured that Sunrisers Hyderabad crossed the finish line and won by 3 runs.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Mumbai Indians Captain:</strong></span> \"Till about the second last over I thought we had it, unfortunate runout there of Tim David. Credit to Sunrisers, they held their nerve pretty well at the back end. We wanted to try a few things while keeping one eye on the future. We wanted certain guys to bowl under pressure in certain situations of the game but I thought they batted pretty well to get 193. The way we pulled things back at the end was very good. Just want to tick off the boxes and finish off on a high note in the last game. We will try everything we can from our side. If there is an opportunity to try out new guys we will definitely look to do that as well.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Kane Williamson, Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain:</strong></span> \"Nice to break the losing streak, had a few games where momentum wasn't on our side and we couldn't wrestle it back. All in all a very good performance and a lot of learning to come out of it. Tripathi is a seriously special player, he comes out and takes the momentum away. Umran always bowls quick, which is obviously a strength and weapon for our side, got an amazing skill set, and if he can channel, he can turn a match as we saw. Priyam is a seriously talented cricketer, great that he could get the opportunity today, he's one of those players we're going to see a lot more of, got a really good head on his shoulders, a lot of potential but a lot of skill as well. Our death bowling has been a strength of ours and Bhuvi's one of the top death bowlers of the tournament, his contribution today and to bowl a maiden is an amazing and a match-winning moment really.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Rahul Tripathi is the Player of the Match.</strong></p><p><strong>Rahul Tripathi:</strong> \"I've enjoyed batting at three. If the ball is there and I can take it on, I will definitely go for the shot. If it's not there then I'll just look to take those singles-doubles. To win games is more important, happy I could do that today. In T20 there cannot be a moment where you can slow down. Every ball is an event so I just think what could be the best result.\"</p>",

Two crucial points are up for grabs as the winner of today's game will move into the Top 4. The last time these two teams met this season, Delhi hammered Punjab in a low-scoring encounter. Will the \"Sadda Punjab\" dominate tonight or will \"Dill Dilli\" emerge victorious again tonight?</p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>Delhi has a slight lead in the head-to-head, winning 15 games when compared to Punjab's 14. However since 2018 Punjab has had the edge, winning 5 of the 9 matches.</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Teams have preferred chasing at the venue, with 10 of the 18 games being won by the chasing side. However the batting side has managed to win 7 of the 8 games when they have posted a total above 165.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings score in each phase at the venue:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) :- 44/2&nbsp;</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) :- 74/2&nbsp;</p><p>Death Overs (16-20 Ov) :- 51/3&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Graeme Smith: \"The key point tonight is one side is short, with 66 meters and that is going to come into play as we have seen good pace and bounce especially in the evening games. Always a lovely grass covering here but underneath it is very dry, you can still see the red soil and you can expect spin to play a part as the breeze comes in. Both captains will want to chase to know what they are chasing.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><strong>Punjab Kings have won the toss and will field first.</strong></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Mayank Agarwal, Punjab Kings Captain:</strong></span> \"We would like to bowl first.

After winning the toss and electing to field, Punjab got off to the perfect start dismissing Warner off the first ball, after which Mitchell Marsh brought up his second consecutive half-century supported by knocks from Sarfaraz Khan and Lalit Yadav helped Delhi post a total of 159 on board. In the chase, Punjab got off to a good start but Delhi bounced back and picked up 5 wickets in the span of five overs, after which Jitesh Sharma scored 44 to take the match till the end but wickets in regular intervals helped Delhi edge Punjab and win by 17 runs.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Mayank Agarwal, Punjab Kings Captain:</strong></span> \"Between 5-10 we lost too many wickets and that's where we lost the game.

That's something we wanted to change as a team and we got it.

The spinners later came in and did a good job. As a bowling unit we were trying to hit good areas. I'm preparing well and whenever I got the chance, trying to put some score and hoping I will continue my run with the bat.\"</p>",

It has been an amazing start for the newbie GT as they become the first team to qualify to the playoffs. On the other hand, it has been a contrasting performance from the defending champions CSK as they get are out of the playoff race. A win for GT today would ensure their position in the top two. When the last time these two teams met it was a nail-biting thriller in which GT beat CSK. Will we see another exciting contest today?</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Sixteen matches have been played here and nine have been won by the teams batting first and seven by the teams chasing the target.

There is a 60m side boundary on one side. The pacers do get bounce but the spinners get turn because of this famous red soil here at the Wankhede. The pitch is dry and there is some grass to hold it together. Day games the spinners can have a say, possibly more than the pacers.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><strong>Chennai Super Kings have won the toss and elected to bat first.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">MS Dhoni, Chennai Super Kings Skipper:</span> </strong>\"We will bat first. It's very hot. The wickets have been used quite a bit so it will slow down. Hope it stays the same throughout or slows down in the second half of the game. We have a lot of changes.&nbsp;<strong><span style=\"color:#222222\">Robbie, Rayudu, Bravo, Theekshana are missing.

The Titans started with a wicket inside the Powerplay, dismissing Devon Conway for 5, after which they continued to apply the brakes during the middle overs and a half-century from Ruturaj Gaikwad took CSK to a score of 133/5 at the end of 20 overs.

It was tough to hit the faster bowlers in the first half. It was coming on better in the second half. With Pathirana, the margin of error is slim.

We will look to give people chances.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Gujarat Titans Captain:</strong></span> \"You don't get extra points for finishing early, so it is important to win. I have enjoyed responsibility and it has helped me. Doing what have done in the past has helped. Ashish Nehra and me are very similar in mindsets. We connect without saying much. We'll see if any player requires rest otherwise we need to keep the momentum. If fast bowlers need rest, we'll rotate otherwise it'll stay the same.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Wriddhiman Saha is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p>Wriddhiman Saha: \"I have been playing for so long. But this setup takes care of the group. I didn't play the initial games but executed my plans when I got a chance. We were not chasing a big target. So I took my chances in the powerplay and then there was no need to take chances as the required rate was under six. My role in the team is to play my natural game in the first six overs. After that, my strengths are to be backed, be it playing the sweep or charging down.\"</p>",

It started off with 210 scored, but in the last few games we have seen the run rate come down. From 9.2 it came down to 6.1 in the last game. Balls per boundary has also gone up. There is a fair bit of grass and looks live and green to me. There will be something for the pacers. This pitch is rolled on nicely, so it might not grip as much.

Bangalore has won seven and lost five matches this season and heads into the contest on the back of consecutive victories, whereas Punjab has won five and lost six matches. When both sides met in the early stages of the tournament this year, Punjab Kings chased down a massive target of 206 and 27 sixes were hit, <strong>the most in a match this year.</strong> <strong>Will we see another high-scoring thriller tonight?</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>The two sides have clashed on 29 occasions in the IPL with Punjab winning 16 of the games. From 2020 onwards, Punjab has won four out of five matches.</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>The Brabourne Stadium has seen the highest run rate (9.17) this IPL. The average score batting first in night games at this venue is 171 and both the batting 1st and chasing sides have won 5 games each in the last 10 games at the ground.</p><p>RCB have lost both their matches at this venue whereas PBKS have won one and lost two.</p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings score in each phase at the venue:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) :- 53/2&nbsp;</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) :- 75/3&nbsp;</p><p>Death Overs (16-20 Ov) :- 43/3&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Matthew Hayden: \"They are mostly the same all-round although one side is just that much bigger. A huge pocket one side, almost 90 meters. Average score batting first here has been 177 but a winning total has been in the 190s. Batters love it here, because, it is an absolute belter. It's hard, nice covering of grass and there will be some swing upfront. Bowlers will hope to get some swing, because if they don't, they'll go the distance as this is a fast-scoring ground.\"&nbsp;</p><div><div> </div><div><strong>TOSS:-</strong></div><div><strong>Royal Challengers Bangalore have won the toss and have elected to field first.</strong></div><div> </div><div><strong>Faf du Plessis, Royal Challengers Bangalore Captain:</strong> \"We'll have a bowl. The trends in the competition suggest that the wickets are getting better, toss isn't making much of a difference. <strong>Same team</strong>, We played some good all-round cricket in the last few games, hopefully everyone can play their role perfectly today as well. Looks like a good wicket, just unsure how it will play early on, so just want to have a bowl.\"</div><div> </div><div><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Mayank Agarwal, Punjab Kings Captain:</strong></span> \"Not a bad toss to lose, want to put runs on the board and put pressure on them. <strong>Harpreet Brar comes in for Sandeep Sharma.</strong> Left-arm spinner against them is a good matchup, so that's why we have made the change.

In the chase, Bangalore scored 31 in the first three overs after which Kagiso Rabada and Rishi Dhawan picked up three wickets in two overs to pull things back for their side. Maxwell and Patidar posted a fifty-run partnership but wickets in regular intervals helped Punjab Kings defend their score and win by 54 runs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Faf du Plessis, Royal Challengers Bangalore Skipper:</strong> \"It was a good score, obviously Jonny the way he started put our bowlers under real pressure. I thought we pulled it back a bit. 200 was about par on that wicket, was a brilliant wicket. When you're chasing scores like that, you can't afford to lose wickets in clusters and unfortunately, that's what happened to us. Not a great outing for us tonight. Will take a day off and then see how we can switch on for a game that's a must-win one for us.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Mayank Agarwal, Punjab Kings Skipper:</strong></span> \"We were brilliant with the bat. Wicket was holding up a bit. The way Jonny and Livi batted, was amazing. We haven't changed a lot to be honest, just about understanding few situations, understanding the wicket. Have to be adaptable and flexible which we have been, which is nice. Can't be too defensive with the ball. Two points the most crucial thing for us.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong><strong>Jonny Bairstow</strong> is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p>Jonny Bairstow: \"It's one of those days. A couple of those come off and it's your day. Many quality bowlers in the IPL and sometimes you've got to try and get them off their lengths.

MI won the toss and decided to bowl first. Daniel Sams (3/16) for MI picked two wickets in the first over and the bowlers kept on putting pressure on CSK by harvesting wickets in regular intervals. MS Dhoni held one end and put up 36 runs. The total was 97 in the end as all the batters were dismissed within the 16th over. In the second innings, CSK picked four wickets in the powerplay and put up pressure straight away, but the stand from Tilak Varma (34* off 32) and the cameo from Tim David (16* off 7) steered the team to victory in the fifteenth over!</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>MS Dhoni, Chennai Super Kings Captain:</strong></span> \"Irrespective of how the wicket is, anything below 130 is difficult to defend, but what I asked the bowlers was to show a lot of character and forget about the result. Both the young fast bowlers bowled really well and I feel a game like this really helps them in believing in themselves that irrespective of the conditions, whenever we start we need to have the same kind of attitude and that's what is needed in the shortest format. We have gone through periods where we never really had that extraordinary bench of fast bowlers. Also fast bowlers they take their time to mature, if you are lucky you get somebody who can feature in all formats in six months time and that is what IPL is doing and it is an opportunity for a lot of them.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Mumbai Indians Captain: </strong></span>\"Looking at how the pitch was playing and to lose wickets upfront, there were tense moments in the middle. It was just about keeping calm and getting the job done. We were a little calm and got the job done in the end. We have played a lot of cricket here. We've had pitches like this. It's nice to get bowlers into the game as well at times. It's been batting-friendly all over, it was good to see bounce and swing from both sides which was good to watch. We want to win games and at the same time we try out certain players. There are options that we still want to try.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Daniel Sams is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p>Daniel Sams: \"The first few games didn't go to plan. Had a little bit of time to reflect on those performances. I just figured out that I was focusing on the batter too much and not on my strengths. We have different plans for different batters. The whole IPL, beautiful wickets to bowl on. It's been enjoyable, today's pitch was bowling-friendly.\"</p>",

When the last time these two teams met, it turned out to be the highest scoring match of this season and the thriller came to an end with RR defending the score. Both the teams have played eleven matches and RR has won seven and DC has won five. The tournament is reaching the business end and the victories for the teams from here on would be crucial to enter the playoffs!</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Seventeen matches have been played here and nine have been won by the teams batting first and eight by the the teams chasing the target.

So one ball will spin and one ball will go straight through. I think it will be very tricky to bat later on. If I were to win the toss, without a doubt I would bat first, try and post 150-160 which could be a very good total.\"</div><div> </div><div><div><strong>TOSS:-</strong></div><div><strong>Delhi Capitals have won the toss and elected to field first.</strong></div><div> </div><div><div><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rishabh Pant, Delhi Capitals Captain: </strong></span>\"We will bowl first. The wicket is dry and there might be dew later on, we will try to capitalize on that. We can hold more in the middle overs and that's something we are looking forward to.

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of Match 57 in the TATA IPL 2023, where the top two sides in the points table, Lucknow Super Giants and Gujarat Titans battle it out at the MCA International Stadium in Pune. The Super Giants are coming off four wins on the trot, all of them coming when batting first. The Titans, on the other hand, head into the contest on the back of consecutive defeats and will be eager to get back to winning ways. The two sides will face each other for the second time, with Gujarat winning the first one and the winner of tonight's contest will become the first team to qualify for the playoffs.&nbsp;<strong>Will it be Ab Apni Bari Hai or Aava De?</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Both Lucknow and Gujarat are undefeated at this venue, having won both their matches. Teams batting first have won 8 of the 11 matches played at this venue this season, including the last five. The average first innings score on this ground is 174 this year and the last three games have seen the 1st batting team post scores of 176, 173, and 202.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings score in each phase at the venue:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) :-&nbsp; 49/1</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) :- 70/3</p><p>Death Overs (16-20 Ov) :- 55/2</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-</strong></p><p><strong>Deep Dasgupta:</strong> \"It's a breezy evening. It's a center wicket, so no clear big-small side. 21 of the 25 wickets taken on pitch number 8 have been by the seam bowlers. A firm, hard deck and the breeze will help pacers.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><strong>Gujarat Titans have won the toss and will bat first.</strong></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Gujarat Titans Captain:</strong></span> \"Think the wicket will play similar. We have won five games where we should've lost, so the odds caught up in the last two games. We told the boys that the tournament is far from over and we have many important matches. Three changes for us, No Lockie and Wade comes in. Sai Sudharshan doesn't play and Sai Kishore makes his debut. Sangwan out, Yash Dayal in. Tactical changes, looking at the opposition and ground dynamics.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>KL Rahul, Lucknow Super Giants Captain:</strong></span> \"We would have wanted to bowl first. Not sure about how this wicket will play, so want to give our bowlers the best shot at using it first. I do think chasing is the perfect game for us, but we have won well after batting first as well. One change for us, Ravi Bishnoi misses out, Karan Sharma replaces him.\"</p>",

Shubman Gill played an unbeaten knock of 63 from 49 and Rahul Tewatia's cameo of 22* from 16 steered the team to a total of 144. In the chase, LSG lost three wickets in the powerplay and Deepak Hooda (27 off 26) managed to steady the innings but wickets fell in regular intervals as Gujarat Titans win this contest by 62 runs. Rashid Khan was the highest wicket-taker of the match with four scalps!</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>KL Rahul, Lucknow Super Giants Skipper:</strong></span> \"It looked like a tricky wicket, that's how it's played here for the last 2 or 3 games that we have played here. We knew it was a low-scoring game, we knew it was a tricky and challenging pitch. We bowled really well, restricting a team under 150 on any pitch is commendable and the bowlers did their job. Some poor shot selections and a run-out didn't help. Good learning for us, hopefully, we can learn from a loss like this. Sometimes you need a little bit of a reminder to keep turning up every game and keep trying to do your best. We have to find ways to score against good oppositions on tricky pitches. That's something we need to learn and figure out.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Gujarat Titans Skipper:</strong></span> \"Really, really proud of the boys. It is a great effort to qualify before the 14th game in this league. We just wanted to be ruthless today, and relax post-game. I rate Sai Kishore quite high as a left-arm spinner, because of the kind of fast bowlers we had, it wasn't possible to play him and Jayant Yadav. Our bowlers did everything that we asked of them, and we ticked all boxes today.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Shubman Gill is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p><strong>Shubman Gill:</strong> \"Always pleasing when you're there till the end and finish the game for your team. I didn't expect the ball to seam as much at the start. It was nipping around, and then I expected the spinners to get some turn. Not a lot of people gave us a chance at the start, but great to qualify now.\"</p>",

The Knights have won only once in their last seven games but still have a mathematical chance to make it to the top 4if things go their way, whereas Mumbai on the other hand are out of the playoff race but have been on an upward trajectory, winning their last two games. The last time these two sides met this season, Pat Cummins smashed the fastest half-century in the IPL and took 35-runs off an over from Daniel Sams, to win by 5 wickets. Will we see another run-scoring spree tonight in what will be <strong>Mumbai Indians' 250th T20 match</strong>?</p><p> </p><p><strong>There is some Injury concern in the MI camp, with Suryakumar Yadav being ruled out for the rest of the tournament with a left forearm muscle injury.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>Mumbai has beaten Kolkata 22 times in 30 IPL games and is the most number of wins for one side against another in the IPL.</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Mumbai have played thrice at the DY Patil Stadium this season, winning once and losing twice, whereas Kolkata has lost both their matches at this venue this IPL. Out of the 16 matches played at the venue so far, nine have been won by the teams chasing the target and seven by the teams batting first. <strong>Spinners have enjoyed bowling at this venue, having the lowest economy here of the four venues in the tournament.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings score in each phase at the venue:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) :-&nbsp; 43/2</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) :- 74/2</p><p>Death Overs (16-20 Ov) :- 53/3</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-</strong></p><p>Graeme Smith: \"It's a patchy surface with a decent amount of grass, but underneath it's very dry red soil. There's a bit of wear and tear on the wicket and a lot of dryness. It will be slow upfront but it will get better as the game progresses.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><strong>Mumbai Indians have won the toss and will field first.</strong></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Mumbai Indians Captain:</strong></span> \"We would like to field first. We keep changing what we want to do as a team. The season has been up and down for us. Every game is a new opportunity, we need to put our right foot forward. We have one change, Surya is injured. Ramandeep comes in for him.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer, Kolkata Knight Riders Captain:</strong></span> \"I was looking to bat first, the wicket looks green. It's good that you bat first and find out what happens. Looking at the changes in the batting lineup, we have a good batting lineup, we need to put up a good total. The opening partnership has been lacking from the first match. We need to come up with a fresh mind. We have made five changes.

MI won the toss and decided to bowl first and Venkatesh Iyer (43 off 24) provided a flying start for Kolkata in the beginning and Nitish Rana (43 off 26) continued the momentum, after which a fiery spell from Jasprit Bumrah (5/10) restricted Kolkata to a total of 165. In the chase, the KKR bowlers dismissed the MI skipper in the first over, after which Ishan Kishan scored his third half-century of the season (51 off 43), but the KKR bowlers continued to pick up wickets in regular intervals and dismissed all the batters of Mumbai for 113 runs.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Mumbai Indians Skipper:</strong></span> \"Was a great effort from the bowling unit, Bumrah was special. Disappointed with the way we batted. Not really difficult to bat on this pitch. We are playing our fourth game here and we know what to expect here. We didn't get partnerships and you need partnerships chasing a total like that. Looking at the way they batted in the first 10 overs, they were 100 runs in 10 or 11 overs, but the way we came back was brilliant. Great effort from Bumrah and the entire bowling unit. It's been that kind of a season where both departments weren't consistent enough. It is something that we wanted to improve today but couldn't do it.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer, Kolkata Knight Riders Skipper:</strong></span> \"Very pleased and feels good to come back and win by a big margin. We had a nice start in the powerplay and Venky targeted his bowlers well. I personally felt that it wasn't easy to start for a new batter. When we went in to bowl, the plan was to hit the right areas and not give room. The win was comprehensive, and when I spoke to the players, they were pumped up to win the game today.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Jasprit Bumrah is the Player of the Match.</strong></p><p><strong>Jasprit Bumrah:</strong> \"Always a good feeling to contribute but the important thing is for the team to win. We had our chance to do that but couldn't get it done. I don't keep track of figures or goals, my aim is to stick to the process. Sometimes you bowl well but don't get wickets. Just want to contribute in whatever way I can. Well, it's about rectifying our mistakes and doing better next season.\"</p>",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the 55th match in the TATA IPL 2023 where the Chennai Super Kings clash against the Delhi Capitals at the DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai. Delhi Capitals is currently at number five on the points table with five wins in ten matches and CSK have won three out of the ten matches they played. This is the first time these two teams meet each other this season. Delhi Capitals come into the contest on the back of a victory and CSK with a loss in their previous game. Will the Yellove win tonight or will Dill Dilli fans dominate their opposition?</p><p> </p><p><strong>Another person had tested positive in the Delhi camp but the game is cleared to go ahead.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>The two teams have faced each other in 26 IPL matches, with Chennai winning 16 of them and Delhi winning 10. However, since 2018 both sides have won 5 games each.</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Fifteen matches have been played here and nine have been won by the teams chasing the target and six by the teams batting first.</p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings score in each phase at the venue:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) :-&nbsp; 42/2</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) :- 73/2</p><p>Death Overs (16-20 Ov) :- 53/3</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-</strong></p><p>Kevin Pietersen: \"One side of the boundary is 64 meters and the other is massive, 78 meters. There was a lot more grass last week. However, it may be a little bit slower and a bit spin orientated. A couple of weeks back there was dew but not so much last week.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>TOSS:-<br />Delhi Capitals have won the toss and will field first.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rishabh Pant, Delhi Capitals Captain:</span> </strong>\"I think the wicket is on the decent side and we want to chase. The season has been up and down. We are focussing on the positives. I have learnt a lot from Dhoni. Let's see how I execute them. Two changes for us. KS Bharat and Axar come in for Mandeep and Lalit Yadav.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>MS Dhoni, Chennai Super Kings Captain:</strong></span> \"We would have bowled first looking at our combination but toss is not in our control. We had a bad season earlier but we made the most of it. When there are a few changes after a big auction, sometimes you need to see what is the best combination. Jaddu is not fit and Dube comes in.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Well, there is another change in the Playing XI&nbsp;</strong><strong>for Chennai&nbsp;</strong><strong>which Dhoni might have forgotten to mention as Bravo is back and replaces Pretorius.</strong></p>",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) :-</strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">Chennai Super Kings- 57/0 (9.5 rpo, 4x4, 3x6)</span> || <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Delhi Capitals - 59/2 (9.8 rpo, 7x4, 3x6)</span></strong></p><p><strong>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) :-&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Chennai Super Kings- 91/1 (10.1 rpo, 8x4, 3x6)&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>||&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Delhi Capitals - 40/5 (4.4 rpo, 3x4, 1x6)</span></strong></p><p><strong>Death Overs (16-20 Ov) :-</strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Chennai Super Kings- 60/5 (12.0 rpo, 5x4, 4x6)&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>||&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Delhi Capitals - 18/3 (6.8 rpo, 2x4, 1x6)</span></strong></p><p> </p><p>Chennai Super Kings register the biggest margin of victory this IPL, as they win by 91 runs. After being put in to bat, Chennai got off to the perfect start from their openers as they registered another century stand, after which Conway continued his fine form and brought up his third consecutive half-century to power CSK to 208. In the chase, Delhi got off to a blazing start inside the Powerplay posting 59 runs on board, after which Moeen Ali and the other Chennai bowlers chipped in with wickets and bundled out Delhi to 117.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rishabh Pant, Delhi Capitals Captain:</strong></span> \"I think they outplayed us in all departments. The only thing we can look forward to is the next three matches, if we win them then we will qualify. There is a fair bit going on amongst us, especially Covid and we had a few stomach infections, but we are not making an excuse and we just want to keep improving. Right now we can be more positive and that's what we are going to be talking about to the boys, let's be more proactive, and let's be in a good frame of mind to make good decisions in the next few matches.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>MS Dhoni, Chennai Super Kings Captain:</strong></span> \"It would have been better if we would have had a win like this somewhere early. It was a perfect game. The batters did really well. Runs on the board really help, and it was important to restrict their big-hitters. Both Simarjeet and Mukesh have taken time to mature, they have the capability, and the more they play, the better they'll get at game sense. Thinking of the NRR doesn't help, you just want to enjoy the IPL. When two other teams are playing, you don't want to be under pressure and thinking. You just have to think about what to do in the next game. If we make the playoffs, great but even if we don't it's not the end of the world.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Devon Conway is the Player of the Match.</strong></p><p><strong>Devon Conway:</strong> \"The thought process was just about keeping it simple. With Hussey, I just discussed how the surface would be and who the bowlers would be to target. I have to be true to myself, authentic to myself. I look to play cricket shots and just assess where to put my foot down. I have to give credit to MS, because I got out trying to play the sweep in the last game, and he told me to look to play straight.\"</p>",

SRH has played ten and won five and RCB has played eleven and won six. SRH lost their last three matches and RCB won their previous match after three consecutive losses. When these two teams met last time this season, SRH bundled out RCB for the lowest total of this season and chased down the target easily. SRH has won both their day matches and RCB has lost their only day match. Will the orange army once again dominate RCB or will RCB play bold and remain in the top four?</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Fourteen matches have been played here and eight have been won by the teams bowling first and six by the teams batting first.</p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings score in each phase at the venue:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) :- 51/1&nbsp;</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) :- 80/2&nbsp;</p><p>Death Overs (16-20 Ov) :- 48/3&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>The two teams have fared off against each other 20 times, and the matchup is inclined towards SRH with 12 wins and RCB has 8 wins.</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew Hayden: \"It's humid and really scorching heat temperatures today. Expect to see a lot of sixes. Most certainly, there's a lot of dryness in areas where we're looking to have that turn. Don't be surprised if you see the ball holding up in today's match. Even with the quicks, the hard length balls and cutters will be hard to score. It's probably a 175-180 wicket. Whoever wins the toss I assume will bat.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>TOSS:</strong></p><p><strong>RCB won the toss and Elected to Bat.</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Faf du Plessis, Royal Challengers Bangalore Captain:</strong></span> \"We'll bat. Nice to win the toss from Kane, he's been winning the tosses. Big confidence for the group from the previous game. Same team. Nice thing with our bowling attack - got quite a lot of options.\"</p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Kane Williamson, Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain:</strong></span> \"Was due to lose one.

RCB won the toss and decided to bat first. After a wicket in the first ball, Faf du Plessis (73* off 50) and Rajat Patidar (48 off 38) bounced back and put up a 105-run stand! When the team settled down well, Glenn Maxwell (33 off 24) and Dinesh Karthik (30* off 8) provided a flourishing&nbsp;finish and the team's score at the end of 20 overs was 192/3. In the chase, RCB started off well with the ball by dismissing both the openers in the first over, after which Rahul Tripathi played a steady innings and scored 58 off 37, but wickets in regular intervals from Hasaranga helped RCB win this game by 67 runs.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Kane Williamson, Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain:</strong></span> \"Its been quite a challenge for us, we need to come up with ways to reverse that pressure and turn around. These have been par totals, the batting has been quality, but as a unit there are areas to touch on. We will have to get a bit more creative and come up with ways to change the momentum. Today we were outplayed, RCB are a really strong side, in fact all teams are strong. For us its about looking to stay calm. We do need to improve, but dont need to overthink.&nbsp; We needed to build some partnerships and take the game deep in order to maximise the opportunities on this Wankhede ground, but we were unable to do that. A lot of learning, we were outplayed like I said, but we do have a gap. So its important for us to reassess and we need to be clear how we target our next matches and take it positively.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Faf du Plessis Faf du Plessis, Royal Challengers Bangalore Captain:</strong></span> \"What we are trying to get better at as a team is making sure that one of those top-four creates a bit of a base. We have got some really strong hitters at the back. The games where we didn't do so well, there was a big cluster of wickets in the powerplay. Obviously some stability but at the same time you gonna make sure you don't go into defensive mode. You still want to try and take the right bowlers on at the right time. DK is in such good form. It was a tricky wicket. A lot of guys, their first few balls, they struggled. Lucky for us, there was a drop catch of DK and he just took them apart. I am glad that I could play a role today in making sure that we can get some runs on the board.\"</p>",

The average score on this used surface is 170. The two previous games on the pitch were played in the first half but the spinners have played a bigger role as the tournament has progressed. The grass has been shaved off, not much grass left and that has exposed the top soil. It is nice and hard but a bit abrasive. It is going to help the spinners a lot more especially with dew not being a factor.\"</span></p>",

After winning the toss, KKR decided to bowl first and dismissed their skipper KL Rahul in the very first over, after which Quinton De Kock (50 off 29) and Deepak Hooda (41 off 27) partnered for 71 runs and steadied the innings. Stoinis (28 off 14) in the end played a quickfire innings to push Lucknow to 176. LSG continued their momentum with the ball and picked up wickets in regular intervals. The flourish of Andre Russell (45 off 19) lasted for a few overs but the other batters got dismissed soon and the team was bundled out in the 15th over.</p><p> </p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Shreyas Iyer, Kolkata Knight Riders Captain:</span></strong> \"They outplayed us in both the departments. We got off to a bad start in the powerplay and also we leaked a lot of runs in the death overs. We couldn't read how the pitch was going to play, and based on that we elected bowling. I thought we could have restricted them to 155-160. They got to a really nice total in the end. We are not able to capitalize on the small things. In the middle overs we have been bowling amazing, just that we need to do well in the powerplay and in the death overs. We need to assess that and bounce back. In the next three games we need to do that.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>KL Rahul, Lucknow Super Giants Captain:</strong></span> \"Played really well, started well with the bat, except for the run out. Was a tricky wicket. Knew it was going to be slow and sticky. Had to get around 150-160. The way Quinton and Deepak batted, made it look easy. Big hitting from Stoinis and Jason gave the momentum. We started superbly with the ball, put the ball in the right areas, couldn't have asked for more. Keep trusting what the best ball is on that wicket. We do have some plans before the game, and what's good to see is they remember those plans under pressure. Still can't think of any game where we've had a complete performance. Still areas to improve. Don't know if we're peaking at the right time but we're getting the wins, we're doing what is expected of us, sticking to our plans.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Avesh Khan is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p>Avesh Khan: \"Goal was to get Russell&nbsp;out. Had a chat with Rahul, the talk was that if I get hit for six off a hard length ball, I'll still back it. Have seen him get out to that length. He's one player who can singlehandedly win the game. My role is to take wickets and win games. The last four matches we've bowled second, so we have an idea of the pitch.\"</p>",

It was a really good wicket and really great intent was shown by almost every batsman. I have been learning a lot as captain, things have been getting clearer and clearer. It's very obvious to think about the points table so when things get busy, we need to keep on coming back to the basics which are focusing on one game at a time and just looking at the controllables. Let's see where we end up at the end of the league stage.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Yashasvi Jaiswal is the Player of the Match.</strong></p><p><strong>Yashasvi Jaiswal:</strong> \"To be honest, I didn't know I'll be the Man of the Match. It's an amazing feeling whenever I go and bat. I just tried to keep it simple - good cricketing shots. I want to dedicate this innings to Zubin sir, he has helped me a lot during all the times. I'll just keep doing what I'm doing, I'll try my best.\"</p>",

Gujarat Titans are currently at the top of the table and lost their previous match against Punjab Kings, whereas their opponents Mumbai Indians won their only match in their last encounter against Rajasthan. This is the first time these two teams meet in this IPL and Hardik Pandya will face his former team for the first time. Which blue will get over the victory line tonight?</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Twelve matches have been played here and seven have been won by the teams chasing the target and five by the teams defending.</p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings score in each phase at the venue:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) :-&nbsp; 52/2&nbsp;</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) :- 76/3&nbsp;</p><p>Death Overs (16-20 Ov) :- 41/3&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Kevin Pietersen: \"This is a beautiful wicket, as good as what it was last night. I don't talk about the dimensions anymore as these guys aren't scared. There were 23 sixes hit on this ground last night, quite a few of them registering over 100m.

After being put in to bat first, the openers got off to the perfect start, putting on 74 runs for the opening partnership, after which Tim David provided the finishing touches, scoring 44 off just 21 balls, helping Mumbai post 177 on board. In the chase, Gujarat were off to a flyer with both their openers scoring half-centuries, but two wickets from Murugan Ashwin and some brilliant fielding helped Mumbai defend their total and win by 5 runs.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Gujarat Titans Skipper:</strong></span> \"We'll take 9 runs in the last over on any given day, but the two run-outs didn't help us. In T20 cricket you can't keep losing back-to-back wickets, it pushes you back. At one point I thought they would post more than 200, but our bowlers did well to restrict them.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Mumbai Indians Skipper:</strong></span> \"It was pretty tight towards the back end. Very satisfying, something we were looking for all this while. Luck has to turn at some stage, we'll take that win with both hands. We were 15-20 runs short and the way we started, we got stuck in the middle. We knew it would be tough, but we held our nerves and that was good to see. A lot depends on how the game is going, who's bowling well on the day. Luckily I had few resources so I could change up. It's important to back the skills you have, Sams was under the pump in a couple of games but I know the quality he has. It's important to back those guys and we are trying to maintain the same squad how much ever possible.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Tim David is the Player of the Match.</strong></p><p><strong>Tim David:</strong> \"Given the context, us winning the game feels great. It was a good batting wicket and shows how well our bowlers bowled in the second half and get us over the line. The wicket was slightly two-paced, it's about starting your innings, if you get off to a flier then you just run with it. It's great to be on the winning side.\"</p>",

SRH won the toss and decided to bowl first. After a wicket fell in the very first over, David Warner got off to a good start and went on to construct 92* runs off 58 deliveries. After Rishabh Pant's cameo (26 off 16), Rovman Powell accelerated further (67* off 35) and the target for SRH was 208.

As a batting unit we had a lot of belief. You know for us it is just going back to the drawing board. Outstanding knock from David Warner and later by Powell. Fantastic learning opportunities for everyone. Umran has been a fantastic find. Things can change quickly if we put things together. They have had rhythm batting in the middle order. Pooran and Markam have been good. Just trying to play a role for the team.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rishabh Pant, Delhi Capitals Captain:</strong></span> \"There is always room for improvement, but it's a perfect game for us as a batting unit. In high chases, the other team needs 10-12 runs per over, it's difficult to hit till the 20th over. I was telling the bowlers to be calm. The way Warner batted, the way he paced the innings, it's one of the best innings. We are just taking one game at a time and trying to give our 100%. Good and important win for us.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>David Warner is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p>David Warner: \"It's a really nice wicket, I've had some success here. I knew if I played my strokes, it was going to come off. Having Rovman at the other end was amazing. I didn't need extra motivation, we've seen what's happened before, it was good to get the win. I said to Powell, I am running two no matter what and I don't care if I get run-out. I am glad he could clear the fence.\"</p>",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of Match 49 in the TATA IPL 2023 where the Royal Challengers Bangalore clash against the Chennai Super Kings at Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Pune. When the last time these two teams met, the result ended in the favour of CSK. RCB has already played ten matches to date and have won five whereas their opponents CSK have played nine and won three. With MSD taking on the captaincy, the team won the last fixture and RCB has lost three matches consecutively. This is a crucial phase of the tournament and this win would be vital for both the teams! Will CSK once again beat RCB or will they change the result this time?</p><p><strong>It is also to be mentioned that this is the 200th match for MS Dhoni in yellow in the IPL!</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Nine matches have been played here and six have been won by the teams defending the target and three by the teams chasing.</p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings score in each phase at the venue:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) :-&nbsp; 46/0&nbsp;</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) :- 72/3&nbsp;</p><p>Death Overs (16-20 Ov) :- 54/2</p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>The two teams have fared off against each other 30 times, and the matchup is inclined towards CSK with 20 wins and SRH has 9 wins.</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Danny Marrison: \"It is subtly drier, more grass taken off. Spinners generally tend to have a massive say in Pune. It is about the pacers. Lot more slower balls are now being bowled. It was 12% in the first half in Pune, now it has increased to 17%, which in turn means the lengths are different and more into the surface. The yorker is a game changer on this pitch if you get it right.\"</p>",

CSK won the toss and decided to bowl first. The RCB openers Virat Kohli (30 off 33) and Faf Du Plessis (38 off 22) steadily started in the powerplay after which M Lomror (42 off 27) went on to accelerate further and D Karthik (26* off 17) played his part as a finisher. With the target being 174 runs to chase, Devon Conway (56 off 37) and Ruturaj Gaikwad (28 off 23) started off well but the team lost wickets in quick intervals. Moeen Ali at five made up 34 off 27, after which the RCB bowlers restricted the batters of CSK well to defend the target.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>MS Dhoni, Chennai Super Kings Captain:</strong></span> \"We did well to restrict them to 170-odd runs. I felt what let us down was the batsmanship. When you are chasing you know what is required and at times you have to curb your instinct and see what really the situation is demanding rather than playing your shots. The shot selection could have been better towards the end. We had a good start and had wickets in hand, the surface kept getting better but we lost wickets at regular intervals. We need to keep looking about what went wrong, it is easy to get distracted with how many points you have, it is the mistakes and it is the process that matters rather than where you are positioned in the points table.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Faf du Plessis, Royal Challengers Bangalore Captain:</strong></span> \"We definitely needed that and are moving in the right direction. We have been very good in the bowling department. The fielding was also amazing, with some great catching and good bowling indeed. We want one of the top four to bat through, need to keep playing the positive brand of cricket. Once you get an opportunity to think of the run rate, you will be able to put on the gas and go for it.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Harshal Patel is the Player of the Match.</strong></p><p><strong>Harshal Patel:</strong> \"In the first over I tried to bowl slower bowls into the wicket but it kind of floated onto the bat. I am glad I was able to come back. To both the left-handers, I was asked to bowl wide outside off so that they hit to the larger side of the ground. When people are waiting for the slower balls, my hard length balls and my yorkers are released. Till now this season I have not been able to bowl those but hopefully will do it in the business end of the tournament.\"</p>",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of Match 48 in the TATA IPL 2023, where the Gujarat Titans faces the Punjab Kings at Dr. DY Patil Sports Academy in Mumbai. Gujarat Titans are on a roll and are at the top of the table with eight victories in nine matches and their opponents' PBKS are at eighth position with eight points. When the first time these two teams met, it was a thriller in which GT won the match on the last ball. GT has played three matches at this venue and won two and lost their only match here, whereas their opponents have played two in which they have won and lost one each. Who could turn out to be victorious this time?</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Fourteen matches have been played here of which eight have been won by the teams chasing and six by the teams defending the target.</p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings score in each phase at the venue:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) :-&nbsp; 43/2&nbsp;</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) :- 74/2&nbsp;</p><p>Death Overs (16-20 Ov) :- 55/2&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Graeme Smith: \"We have one big boundary and one small boundary here so it will help to have a left-right combination. Much better surface, more even grass covering. Expect the ball to come on better, strokeplay to be better. Expect captains to win the toss, stick to the formula and bowl first.\"</p>",

After winning the toss Gujarat became the first team to opt to bat in a night game, after which Punjab Kings restricted them to 143/8 courtesy of Kagiso Rabada who picked up 4 wickets. In the chase, Shikhar Dhawan steadied the innings getting his 47th IPL Fifty, after which Liam Livingstone scored 30* off 10 balls to finish the game with 4 overs remaining!</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Gujarat Titans Captain:</strong></span> \"Obviously we were not even close to par. 170 would have been an ideal score but we kept losing wickets and did not get any rhythm. I back my decision to bat first because we need to put ourselves in difficult situations where we come out of our comfort zone. We've been doing well chasing but we wanted to make sure that we put our batters under pressure so that when the right game comes and we have to bat first, we should know how we have to go. We didn't get the start we wanted but I'll take the loss as a learning curve and as I said we need to come out of our comfort zone, try to bat first and put up some totals as well. We'll have a chat about where things did not go our way and focus on the things we need to get better for our next game.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Mayank Agarwal, Punjab Kings Captain:</strong></span> \"We would like to string a few wins, no better time than getting a few wins back-to-back. It was nice the way Livingstone played, got the score quickly.&nbsp;When we got to that position, two points are almost clear, if we can score it as quickly as possible, we could also improve the Net Run-Rate. I thought we bowled exceedingly well, we got early wickets and choked them in the middle. That really help us to restrict them to a below-par score.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Kagiso Rabada is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p>Kagiso Rabada: \"Finally we got the win. After being a bit inconsistent, we just wanted to string a couple of wins under our belt. We bowled well to restrict them. Our batters did the job. As a team, we had a good outing. As a bowler, you have to bowl in all stages of the game. It's about figuring out how to be the most effective in each stage of the game.\"</p>",

This is the second time these two teams face off this season and the first one was won by RR. RR is in the third position from first and KKR is third from last in the points table. KKR lost their last five encounters and RR also comes back after a loss. Who will win tonight and score their crucial two points?</p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>The two teams have faced each other 25 times, and 13 were one by KKR and 12 by RR.</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Twelve matches have been played here, six have been won by teams batting first and six by the teams chasing the target.</p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings score in each phase at the venue:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) :- 41/2</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) :- 72/2</p><p>Death Overs (16-20 Ov) :- 58/1</p>",

KKR won the toss and decided to bowl first and their bowlers did well to restrict the RR batters to 38 runs in the powerplay and did not give the room for the batters to settle. Sanju Samson constructed a well-made 54 off 49 and Hetmyer in the end played a quick cameo of 27* from 13 balls. With the target being 153 for KKR to chase, they lost their openers in the powerplay after which, Shreyas Iyer (34 off 32) and Nitish Rana (48* off 37) built up a 60 run partnership. Rinku Singh came to the crease in the 14th over and went to play a quickfire innings of 42* off 23 and KKR won the match with still five balls to spare and breaks their losing streak.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Sanju Samson, Rajasthan Royals Captain:</strong></span> \"The wicket was a bit slow, but they also bowled really well. With the kind of batting we have, we would have liked a few more boundaries at the end and finished off a bit better. It was a great effort with the ball, we showed some real fight in the game and the energy was really amazing. We have to keep on assessing the game and who is batting with you, wickets at the wrong time stopped me to keep on going with the momentum.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer, Kolkata Knight Riders Captain:</strong></span> \"Right from the powerplay when our bowlers conceded just 36 runs and took a wicket, it was just the start we needed. We have been talking about Umesh right from the start. He has increased his pace, bowls those hard lengths and as a captain you just have to give him the ball to deliver. Whenever I give Sunil Narine the ball, he gets me wickets, but the batsmen don't take chances against him. He is very economical, but when he gets a wicket, he gets a big one. The way Rinku was maintaining his calm, playing only his second or third game, is outstanding. He is a great asset for the franchise for the future.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Rinku Singh is the Player of the Match.</strong></p><p><strong>Rinku Singh:</strong> \"A lot of players have played Ranji from Aligarh, but I am the first to play IPL. This is a big league and there is a lot of pressure obviously. I have been waiting for the last five years to get a chance. I worked very hard, came back from injury and did well in the domestic circuit as well. When I was batting, Shreyas Iyer and McCullum told me to stay till the end and finish it.\"</p>",

Tonight, Sunrisers Hyderabad lock horns with Chennai Super Kings at Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Pune. These two teams have already played a match this season and SRH won that fixture by 8 wickets. SRH is currently at number four with five victories and CSK is with two victories. The big news for the game is that MS Dhoni has once again stepped in as the skipper.

It turned out to be a slow track, it was difficult for the batters to time when the bowlers were on the slower side. It was gripping and the pitch was spongy but today, the grass has been shaved off and the soil has been rolled, so there will not be spongy bounce and there might be less grip, it isn't as abrasive either and so should come to the bat better. Batting first might not be a bad idea on this track.\"</div></div></div>",

The opening duo put up the highest partnership of this season of 182 off 107 and Ruturaj got dismissed for 99 runs from 57 deliveries! Devon Conway was unbeaten till the end and scored 85* off 55 balls. With the target being 203, the openers Abhishek Sharma and Kane Williamson provided a nice start to their team after which they got out for 39 and 47 runs respectively.

I thought we responded well to it, but they kept us under pressure with the total they had. We did show a lot of fight and were unlucky at times with some things that didn't go our way. Still, we can look back at the game with a lot of positives, we came up against quality spinners, at the end of the day, we did show a lot of fight. We just need to stay connected, we're playing well. We just need to touch on a few things, shape well and come back stronger in the next game\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>MS Dhoni, Chennai Super Kings Skipper:</strong></span> \"I think it was a good score to defend. It's one of those coincidence where we got off to a good start and forced the bowlers to bowl the areas where we wanted to hit. The kind of target we got was a very good one. The phase that really worked for us was where the spinners were bowling after 6 overs. We have had quite a few good batting performances, we have given couple of overs that went for 25-26 runs, and even when you score 200, it really comes down to 175-180 in 19 overs.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p>Ruturaj Gaikwad: \"Felt good and it has come in a winning way, this knock feels more special.

We came close few games but we are losing it. Really happy that the bowlers pulled it back but on these kinds of wickets when the bowlers put up a helping hand, we got to perform as a batting unit as well. It was really nice to see the way Mitch Marsh was batting but as a batting unit we need to start converting those 30s and 40s into a big score. Hopefully we can turn it around.

Mohsin Khan has been brilliant, played him in the nets first time a month ago and didn't want to face him. He was sharp and scary at times in the nets. It's not just the pace, he has a good brain, has a bit of skill as well, has a great slower one and he knows when to use them. Hooda has been batting well, he's batted well throughout the season. He's been smart and he's read the situation really well. We did want to use the powerplay. When you're batting first, you generally want to take a couple of balls and see what the pitch is like and then play your big shots but Quinton was going from ball one. The start we got really set us up and we played well after that as well. It's been hot, felt like 100 degrees today, I was just cramping and nothing else. It's the last afternoon game, so really happy.\"</div><div> </div><div><div> </div><div><strong>Mohsin Khan is the Player of the Match</strong></div><div>Mohsin Khan:&nbsp;\"I am so happy today. My mom and dad would be seeing it on TV. I enjoyed Pant's wicket the most. Because I set him up by bowling back of a length. Rahul bhai told me to bowl a really full ball he won't be expecting and I did what he said and got the wicket. I just want to continue doing what I am doing. I just want to execute what I practice in the nets. I don't think too much. Right from the start I look to bowl fast. I just want to try and do well with the opportunities I get and keep winning games for the team.\"</div></div></div>",

Looks a little bit patchy and it's dusty. The spinners are going to come into their own today. When it's as dry and dusty as that, the ball is going to grip and turn. This pitch will not be easy to bat on. The ball will not come on at a uniform pace, it'll be two-paced. There are patches where it'll grip and there are patches where it'll skid on. If you can restrict a team to 160, you are in with a very good chance.\"</div></div></div></div>",

Suryakumar Yadav (51 off 39) and Tilak Varma (35 off 30) stood together for 81 runs and guided the team nearer to the target.

After winning the toss and electing to bat, Bangalore posted 170 after 20 overs led by half-centuries from Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar. In the chase, Saha and Gill put on their second consecutive half-century partnership and got the team off to a good start after which the finishers Miller and Tewatia took over to take Gujarat home in yet another final over thriller.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Gujarat Titans Captain </strong></span>- \"That's the beauty of this team, people coming in and showing what they can do in clutch situations is becoming quite a habit, something I don't mind happening. We always back them to do it, but they're defying odds time and again. Credit to their confidence level, the self-belief that they're having, making sure they can finish games. This win is dedicated to the people of Gujarat, as it's Gujarat Day tomorrow, thanks for all the love and wishes you've shown us. As I have played a lot in Maharashtra, happy Maharashtra day as well.\"</p><div> </div><div><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Faf du Plessis, Royal Challengers Bangalore Captain:</strong></span><span style=\"color:#242424\"> \"We were trying to get to 175-180, the foundation was good, but they did bowl well in the middle overs, and I thought we were 5-10 runs short of a total which I felt was very good. We started well with the ball, but credit to the GT guys for being consistent right through the campaign, they have been so calm during their chases. It was a good effort to come out and bat like that as a team, especially after what happened during the last two games, that confidence is what we'll take forward, but we conceded 2-3 easy boundaries on the short side, but it still needed some quality finishing from them. Cricket is a massive game of confidence and to get a solid fifty, it's big for Kohli and for us, something that we can take forward. You will need someone in the top-4 to go out and make those 70s and 80s, scores around 30s and 40s will not help win matches.\"</span></div><div> </div><div><strong><span style=\"color:#242424\">Rahul Tewatia is the Player of the Match.</span></strong></div><div> </div><div><span style=\"color:#242424\"><strong>Rahul Tewatia:</strong> \"I can't say that I stay cool during chases, but a lot of things will be going beneath, as to how to take it forward, which bowler to target and which areas to hit. I then try and follow the plans. In the death overs, you'd need to play some pre-planned shots, but I certainly look at the field and then look at the ball before hitting. I have bettered my off-side game during this tournament, the bowlers had planned to keep fielders in the off-side, so I knew it I could hit the gaps and get the boundaries. The pitches have been really good, you can chase even 60 runs off the final 5 overs. I have spent a lot of time with Miller, we were together at PBKS for a year and with RR for a couple of years, so we have a good bonding and talk about finishing games even in the nets. I have the belief in myself that I can finish games as long as I stay in the middle.\"</span></div>",

Not so much fuller, it's about bowling length and it's about bowling bouncers and getting people out with the short ones. You can see why the players want to bowl short, because of this beautiful, even covering of grass. Guys with pace and energy love it here.

We had batsmen who were set and we kept getting out. So many soft dismissals for us. It is disappointing and we have to face the truth. We didn't bat well enough and we were below par with the bat. The new ball was doing a bit, seaming around and there was some bounce, it was a crucial period and after that it did get better to bat on.

The way we responded with the ball was phenomenal. Krunal has been brilliant throughout the tournament. I think we just need to be smarter in reading the game. If we could have not played too many shots we could have done better. We have been good on the field and good with the ball.

For the last 7-8 months, I have been working hard. Lot of times when you are playing shorter formats you don't realize a lot of things. I have been trying to increase my height with my release and some things on my grip. Batting is slightly close to my heart. I haven't been contributing much with the bat but it is a long tournament and going forward I will look to contribute with the bat.\"</div></div>",

The two sides have been exceptional with their bowling so far in the tournament and have the two best bowling strike rates and economy this season. The Kane Williamson-led team has been on a roll, winning 5 games on the trot, whereas the Titans have won six of their seven games this year, and their only loss was in the hands of SRH in their previous encounter this season.

In the last five matches at this venue, the teams batting first have been able to defend their score successfully and the average 1st innings score has risen to 186 after 149 from the first 4 games.

It's very dry and maybe it's an advantage to bat upfront, try and get some total on the board because chasing is proving to be very difficult as the tournament wears on.\"</p>",

In the chase, Gujarat got off to the perfect start, putting on 59 runs in the Powerplay without losing a wicket, after which Umran Malik steamed in and picked up his first five-wicket haul.

Could have gone either way, but great learning for us. It was a fantastic finish by Shashank Singh, he played beautifully. Credit to Gujarat as they played outstandingly well and we'll take positives out of this game. Umran Malik has been bowling beautifully, an outstanding performance by him. Sometimes you are blown away by the better side, credit to them as they played outstandingly well. There's a lot of learning for us, but with two strong sides such things happen.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Gujarat Titans Captain:</strong></span> \"It's happening so often that I fear we may run out of luck in the knockout games. We keep a very chilled atmosphere and ensure everyone is stepping up. It's a long tournament and I don't want to get too excited early, we're quite practical, we've spoken about winning these situations and there is a lot of self-belief in the camp. It's important to keep the calm in the dugout, a lot of credit goes to the support staff for how they've been handling the players.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Umran Malik is the Player of the Match.</strong></p><p><strong>Umran Malik:</strong> \"I always bowl fast but I've been trying to bowl better lines and lengths. I was trying to rotate between my plans.

If you hit the deck hard in the first few overs, it is hard to get away. The dropped chance cost us. The top order is a trick we need to fix. You need someone in the top four to bat through and we haven't done that consistently.

It was a matter of putting in pressure.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Riyan Parag is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p>Riyan Parag:\" A bit of satisfaction. The Royals have shown faith in me for the last three years, and I am paying them back bit by bit. I love pressure and I am just showcasing my abilities. During the time-out, Sanga came out and we agreed that 140 was a good total on this wicket. We decided to go big in the last two overs.\"</p>",

Tonight, Punjab Kings lock horns with Chennai Super Kings at Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. The tournament is mid-way and the teams started playing their second fixtures. In the first match between the two teams, PBKS won by 54 runs. Currently, CSK is placed last before on the points table with four points and PBKS is just above them with three victories. This result would be a crucial one for both teams. Will the Kings from Punjab defeat CSK once again this season or will CSK roar back tonight?</p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>Chennai Super Kings and Punjab Kings have clashed on 26 instances of which 15 have been won by CSK.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>The trend of winning teams has changed in recent games. In the 8 matches played here, the first four have been by the chasing sides and the next four by batting first.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings score in each phase at the venue:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) :-&nbsp; 40/2</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) :- 68/3&nbsp;</p><p>Death Overs (16-20 Ov) :- 59/1</p><p> </p><p><strong>Pitch report:</strong></p><p>Graeme Swann:&nbsp;\"This pitch has been used before. It's a hard wicket, but the slower deliveries will grip a bit. The surface has good bounce and batting first would be a good choice, a total of 170-180 will be a good total here.\"</p>",

After being put into bat, Shikhar Dhawan held the crease till the end for Punjab and scored an unbeaten 88 off 59 with Rajapaksa partnering him for 42 runs. Towards the end, Liam Livingstone played a quick cameo of 19 from 7 and helped the team post a score of 187/4. In the chase, CSK started slowly after which Rayudu scored 78 to take Chennai close to victory but Punjab held their nerve in the end to hold Jadeja and Dhoni and emerge victorious.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ravindra Jadeja, Chennai Super Kings Captain:</strong></span> \"We started off very well with the ball, but we felt we gave away 10-15 runs extra at the end. We did not execute our plans very well. Rayudu was batting brilliantly throughout but as I said earlier, if we could've restricted them to under 175 it would've been good. We are not getting good starts in the first 6 overs, that's where we are lacking and hopefully we will come back stronger.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Mayank Agarwal, Punjab Kings Captain:</strong></span> \"I thought Arshdeep bowled exceedingly well, he has bowled the tough overs for us and has been great for us. Even Rabada bowled well, to get Ruturaj and get Rayudu at that stage. These two have been great for us. As a team we have to think about being smart, you want your opposition to play towards the longer side as much as they can. We have won one tonight, but we need to win two or three on the bounce.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Shikhar Dhawan is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p><strong>Shikhar Dhawan:</strong> \"I always talk about the process and focus on it. Regarding my fitness and my approach, I keep working on those skills and the results will take care of itself. The wicket was stopping a bit, I tried to go for the big shots, but I couldn't connect initially and once I got set, I was able to get those boundaries, that's what I bank on. While batting first it's about putting pressure on the bowlers and getting boundaries.\"</p>",

But there was not a firm stand from the middle order batters except Tilak Varma who scored 38 off 27. Krunal Pandya picked 3 wickets in the final over and LSG once again beats MI.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Mumbai Indians Captain: </strong></span>\"I thought we bowled pretty okay. It was a good pitch to bat on. I thought that score should have been chased down, but we didn't bat well enough. When you have a target like that, it is important to string partnerships. But some irresponsible shots in the middle, including mine. We didn't get the momentum. They bowled really well. We haven't batted well enough in this tournament. Whoever plays in the middle needs to take that responsibility and go on to play long innings. One guy needs to ensure that he bats as long as possible. The season hasn't gone the way we would have wanted it to, but such things happen.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>KL Rahul is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#1abc9c\"><strong>KL Rahul, Lucknow Super Giants Captain and Player of the Match:</strong></span> \"Trying to play according to the situation. Enjoying batting, enjoying the responsibility. Fingers crossed I can keep doing the right things. First thought was just get bat on ball, feel good, get that single. When you've played in a venue that's been good to me previously, but not so much in the last two games, just wanted to get that single first. Lucky that I could score as much as I did.\"</p>",

Both teams head into the contest on the back of winning runs, with the Bangalore-based franchise winning five of their last six matches and Sunrisers Hyderabad winning four consecutive matches after losing their first two games. Who will continue their winning spree tonight?</p><p> </p><p><strong>Kane Williamson wins yet another toss and Sunrisers will bowl first!</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>Sunrisers Hyderabad leads the head to head, winning 11 of the 20 encounters between these sides. However, since 2018 it has been a close affair with Sunrisers edging Bangalore 5-4.</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This will be Bangalore's first match at the venue whereas Hyderabad has played one game here and came out victorious. In 5/6 night games at the venue, the teams batting first have posted a total above 175 and the average first innings score for night games at the venue is 181. Teams chasing have won four of the six night games at the venue. In the last two games at the venue, the spinners have played a crucial role, picking up 63% of the wickets.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings score (Night matches) in each phase at the venue:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) :-&nbsp; 55/2</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) :- 82/3&nbsp;</p><p>Death Overs (16-20 Ov) :- 44/3</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-</strong></p><p>Simon Doull: \"It is a very high-scoring ground, the surface looks magnificent. Five times the team batting second has won, four times the team batting first has won. It's got a nice covering of grass on it, great sound to it, good pace and bounce. The grass coverage just gives a little bit of pace and bounce as well. If you do have to bat first, put 180+ on the board and you are in the game.\"</p>",

In the chase, Abhishek Sharma got Hyderabad off to a flyer and helped them chase the total in 8 overs.</p><p> </p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Faf du Plessis, Royal Challengers Bangalore Captain:</span></strong>&nbsp;\"The first four overs, we shouldn't have lost so many wickets, it was a bit spicy upfront. We just needed to get through that phase where the ball was swinging and seaming, once you get through it, it becomes easier. This wicket looked the best, the expectations were pretty high, it was a very good wicket. There are no excuses though. Jansen bowled well in his first over swinging the ball both ways and got the big wickets.&nbsp; As a team we need to move forward, it's a long tournament.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Kane Williamson, Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain:</strong></span> \"The guys bowled beautifully and we caught well. It was an outstanding performance, but for us it's about looking forward to the next challenge. The ball is swinging a lot more this season, so we have been taking wickets in the powerplay. Jansen is always up for a laugh off the field, but he is very focused. He has got the skills to do that, he is a real treat for us. You want to do as well as you can. Abhishek has been timing the ball brilliantly. There are a few challenges coming up ahead, so need to be focused.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Marco Jansen is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p><strong>Marco Jansen:</strong> \"I try to keep it as simple as possible, sometimes it works. I thought the ball was going to swing nicely after the first ball I bowled, the second ball was angled across the right hander, but I enjoyed the third wicket the most. This is the best spell I have bowled with the white ball so far.\"</p>",

After choosing to bat for the first time this IPL, Gujarat posted 156 on board led by a third half-century on the trot from their skipper. The Titans continued their momentum, with the ball this time in the second innings, dismissing the KKR Top 4 inside the first 7 overs, after which Rinku Singh stabilized Kolkata's innings and a quickfire innings from Andre Russell took the match till the last over, but Alzarri Joseph held his nerve to help Gujarat win by 8 runs.&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer, Kolkata Knight Riders Captain:</strong></span> \"The way we started in the powerplay while chasing and even with the ball was where we lost the match.

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of Match 34 in the TATA IPL 2023, where the Delhi Capitals square off against the Rajasthan Royals. The match was earlier supposed to happen at the MCA Stadium in Pune but has been shifted to the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai due to COVID-19 cases in the Delhi camp. The Royals have won four of their six encounters, while the Capitals have won three and lost as many so far.&nbsp;</p><p><br />In this year's IPL, teams batting second have been more successful until now, winning 18 and losing 14 matches but all of Rajasthan's four wins this season have come when batting first.<br /> </p><p>The Royals have the best economy rate in the Powerplay, so far this season and will be up against an in form David Warner and Prithvi Shaw, who has notched up 4 consecutive 50-run stands for the opening wicket. Will this phase decide the outcome of today's game?</p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>The two teams have fared off against each other 24 times, with both sides equally winning 12 of them.</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>The average first innings total at the Wankhede Stadium this season has been 158, the lowest among all four venues. Defending totals seems to be the trend at the Wankhede with two games on the trot going in favour of teams batting first.</p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings score in each phase at the venue:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) :-&nbsp; 41/2</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) :- 58/3&nbsp;</p><p>Death Overs (16-20 Ov) :- 59/1</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong></p><p>Graeme Swann:&nbsp;\"Just 61m to the leg side and 67m on the other side. It's an absolute belter. Little bit of grass but it is rock hard, Maybe a bit of turn on this wicket, but overall a very good batting wicket and expect high scores\"&nbsp;</p>",

After being put in to bat, Rajasthan went guns blazing recording the highest opening partnership for this year's IPL, followed by a third-century from Jos Buttler in the season, to help them post a mammoth total of 222 on board. In the chase, Delhi got off to a quick start from their openers but wickets in regular intervals from Rajasthan helped restrict Delhi to 36 from 6. In the last over Rovman Powell scored three maximums of the first three balls but McCoy held his nerve to deliver a dot ball in the next ball and take Rajasthan across the line.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Rishabh Pant, Delhi Capitals Captain:</strong></span> \"I think they were bowling well throughout the game but in the end, Powell gave us a chance, I thought that no-ball could have been precious for us but it is not in my control. It is disappointing to go so close especially when the other team has scored 200+. I think we could have bowled much better. I can tell the guys to keep their chin up and prepare for the next one.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Sanju Samson, Rajasthan Royals Captain:</strong></span> \"It was a full toss and the batsman wanted a no-ball, but the umpire didn't give it. We wanted to be around him and wanted to put a smile on his face. Not easy for a bowler after conceding three sixes. We wanted to change the plan so we took our time, to give the bowler a breather. The last game was a tough one, and this game too, with Powell hitting those sixes. It's important to stay calm and trust your teammates. You need to back yourself. Can't say anything about the toss. Losing toss is working, so we'll like to stick to that. Don't think there was much dew, but the bowlers are experienced enough to bowl in these conditions.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Jos Buttler is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p><strong>Jos Buttler, Player of the Match:</strong> \"Was a special knock, enjoyed it. I love this stadium, it was a fantastic atmosphere, my first IPL was here with the Mumbai Indians. I am enjoying the best form of my life, I need to continue with this form all the way through. Devdutt played well from the other end, and we decided to attack and put the pressure back on Delhi. The wickets may change, there are going to be used wickets. There wasn't any dew tonight, the teams might favour batting first. Everyone will need to adapt as the tournament goes on.\"</p>",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the El-Clasico in the TATA IPL. It is the 33rd match in this season where the Mumbai Indians square off with Chennai Super Kings at Dr. DY Patil Stadium. Considering the success of the teams in the history of IPL, this season has not been the same for both the franchises. MI is the only team without a win yet in this season and is at the bottom of the table, whereas CSK is just ahead of them with two points. This is the seventh match for both teams. CSK had their only victory at this venue and MI are playing their second match here. <strong>Who will end successful in this historic rivalry?</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians have confronted on 32 occasions and MI has better records of winning 19 of them.</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>In the 11 matches sported here, the last three matches and in total five matches have been won by teams batting first.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings score in each phase at the venue:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) :-&nbsp; 43/2</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) :- 78/2&nbsp;</p><p>Death Overs (16-20 Ov) :- 51/3</p><div> </div><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-</strong></p><p>Matthew Hayden: \"It is a hot and humid evening.

CSK won the toss and followed the trend by bowling first. Mukesh Choudhary of CSK dismissed the openers for a duck in the very first over. After which MI fought hard with the help of Tilak Varma's 51 off 43 and managed to put up a total of 155. MI also started by taking the opener for a duck after which the steady partnership from Uthappa(30 off 25) and Rayudu(40 off 35) got the team nearer to the target. The quick cameo from Pretorius(22 from 14) was very crucial in the end and the classic finisher MS Dhoni(28* off 13) finished the match with a boundary on the last ball!</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Mumbai Indians Captain:</strong></span> \"In the end it was a great fight from us, the bowlers kept us in, but in the end, you know how towering MSD can be and he took them home. It's hard to put a finger on anything, but we're not starting well in the match, if you lose quick wickets you'll always be playing the catching game. We always back ourselves to do well, but as I said, we lost too many early wickets, we did make a good comeback with both bat and ball, but it wasn't enough in the end.\"</p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">Ravindra Jadeja, Chennai Super Kings Captain:</span></strong> \"We were very tense the way up front game was going. But the great finisher of the game was still there, so we knew we had a chance. He's still here and doing it for us. Mukesh has bowled well up front and done well for us in the powerplay. We need to work on our fielding, can't afford to drop catches.\"</p><p><strong>Mukesh Choudhary is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p><strong>Mukesh Choudhary:</strong>\" Have to bowl well in the powerplay where I'm supposed to bowl three overs. There is no pressure actually, to play with such big players around you automatically takes all the pressure away. I just want to have a good time and enjoy myself.\"</p></div>",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The match is ON! </strong>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of match 32 in the TATA IPL 2023. Delhi Capitals will square off with Punjab Kings at Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai. The Delhi Capitals have played 5 matches till now and have won two out of them at this same venue, whereas their opponents Punjab Kings have played 6 matches and have won all their alternative games from the second match. PBKS featured at this venue twice and has won one match here. DC will miss the services of Mitchell Marsh and Tim Seifert in this match. Could DC maintain the victory record at this venue? or will PBKS break their streak?</p><div><div> </div><div><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></div></div><div><div>Delhi and Punjab have clashed on 28 instances in which 15 have been won by PBKS. However, the equation has been evenhanded since 2018.</div><div> </div><div><div><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></div><div>In the 8 matches sported here, four-four have been won by batting first and bowling first. So, the toss seems not to play a crucial role as in the other venues.</div><div><div><strong>Average 1st Innings score in each phase at the venue:-</strong></div><div>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) :-&nbsp; 57/1</div><div>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) :- 86/2&nbsp;</div><div>Death Overs (16-20 Ov) :- 50/3</div><div> </div><div><div><strong>Pitch Report:</strong></div><div>Simon Doull: \"This was the same pitch that was used a couple of nights ago between Rajasthan Royals and Kolkata Knight Riders, it produced 427 runs. It has a little less grass than it had the other night. But the boundaries are shorter, 65-66 meters on one side. There is going to be plenty of runs in it again. So if you are bowling first the spinners are definitely going to come into play. Still think it is a 180-190 surface though\"</div></div></div></div></div>",

After winning the toss, DC put PBKS to bat first and dismissed the key three batters of the side within the powerplay. PBKS lost wickets one by one in the course of the game and this affected the team's progression. Jitesh Sharma in the middle was the highest run-getter of the side scoring 32 runs. In the end, PBKS registered the lowest total of this season-115. DC was dominant with the bat too as David Warner(60* off 30) and Prithvi Shaw(41 off 20) fired early. And DC chased down the target with still 9 wickets remaining.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div> </div><div><span style=\"color:#e74c3c\"><strong>Mayank Agarwal, Punjab Kings Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"It's a tough one, a day to forget for us, best to move on and not think too much into the game. We didn't bat and bowl well, we just need to move on from today. We have been losing too many wickets too early, that's a concern. Don't want to dwell too much, if we do so, a lot of negatives will come out. A total of around 180 could have been competitive.\"</div><div> </div><div><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rishabh Pant, Delhi Capitals Captain:</strong></span> \"Obviously there was confusion in our camp because in the morning we got to know that Tim is also positive. There was so much noise from the outside we thought we will focus on the match. We will look to improve in every match and that's the only thing we can control, results are not in our control but we can learn from our mistakes.\"</div><div> </div><div><div><strong>Kuldeep Yadav is the Player of the Match</strong></div><div><strong>Kuldeep Yadav:</strong> \"I would like to share this award with Axar. He bowled well and took important wickets in the middle. I have played a lot against Rabada and I know he does not move his feet much, my plan was to bowl one chinaman and then the googly. The second wicket was due to Rishabh telling me to bowl from round the wicket. I have got plenty of confidence this season and I am also mentally clear with my role. I just focus on my line and length and not on what the batter is going to do. I am enjoying my bowling after a long time and the credit goes to Rishabh for backing me.\"</div></div>",

Both teams have registered four wins in their six matches so far and their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. However, the two sides have contrasting records at the DY Patil Stadium this season, with Lucknow winning both their matches and RCB winning one and losing two.</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>While teams have preferred to chase in night games this IPL, the last two night matches at the venue were won by the teams batting first. The average score batting first in the venue in night games is 174 and in the last two games the teams batting first posted scores above 190.</p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings Scores in each phase:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) - 43/2</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) - 77/2</p><p>Death Overs (16-20) - 51/3</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-</strong></p><p>Kevin Pietersen: \"One side boundary is 66 meters, the other side is 78m. The surface seems very dry and has less grass on one end compared to the other end. I expect the seamers to prefer the end where they can bowl with more grass.

RCB being put to bat first lost two of their crucial wickets in the initial over. The skipper Faf Du Plessis (96 off 64) held the one end till the last over and led the team to a total of 181. When LSG came to bat, they lost wickets in crucial stages of the game. Krunal Pandya with the bat was the highest run-getter of the team with 42 runs in 28 deliveries. Josh Hazlewood was very effective for RCB with the ball as he ended his quota by taking four wickets for 25 runs.&nbsp;</div><div> </div><div><div> </div><div><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>KL Rahul, Lucknow Super Giants Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"I think we started really well, after getting 2 wickets in the first over and then give away 50 in the powerplay, we could have done better. 180 on that pitch was 15-20 extra runs we gave away, we couldn't really squeeze in the middle and with the bat as well we needed one in the top three to go deep and the other batters to bat around him and unfortunately we couldn't do that. We have a really good team, very happy with how we are playing, yes a couple of games we could have done better.\"</div><div> </div><div><div><div> </div><div><strong>Faf Du Plessis is the player of the match!&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Faf du Plessis Royal Challengers Bangalore captain &amp; Player of the Match:</span> \"</strong>&nbsp;We needed someone to stabilise the innings and then get going at the back end. Today, grateful that I could do it. Early in the innings, there was help for the bowlers and they did get us in trouble but we found a way. Our bowlers then stuck to the plans and when you do that on a ground like this, it's tough for the batters. At the moment, lot of teams at the top, and many in the middle, and when that happens. But that's out of our control. We need to just working on our strengths and we actually can get better in a few things. Need one guy to bat through consistently, but we haven't had that frequently. DK has saved us quite a bit, hopefully today is a stepping stone in that direction.\"</div></div></div></div><div> </div>",

KKR won the toss and put RR to bat first. RR got off to a flying start with Jos Buttler going impregnable at one end! He whittled his second century of the season and got out at 103 runs from just 61 balls. After which Hetmyer played a quick cameo and fetched the team the highest total of this season. RR opened with the same grit and picked a wicket on the very first ball. Aaron Finch and Shreyas Iyer joined hands to put up a 107-run stand after which Finch got dismissed. Shreyas Iyer took the game deep, but he was expelled by brilliant bowling from Chahal who finished the match with a fifer which includes a hattrick. Umesh Yadav towards the end struck some huge ones and kept the hopes alive, but it was RR who held their nerve and truly bagged their triumph!</div><div> </div><div><div><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Shreyas Iyer, Kolkata Knight Riders Captain:</span></strong> \"I think from the start we got, we really were going well according to the run-rate. Finchy was good but once he was out, we slowed down a bit. We lacked a bit over there, but it's a part of the game. My plan was to bat through the end, the opposite batsman had to take it on from ball one. Dew didn't play a big role tonight. Amazing wicket to bat on. Unfortunately,, Brabourne hasn't been great for us. Hopefully we will come back hard in the coming games.\"</div><div> </div><div><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Sanju Samson, Rajasthan Royals Captain: </strong></span>\"It got tensed. The quality of the players made it very interesting. Very happy about the win. There are some things that need to be used at the right time. You need to be smart enough to slow it down. I respect KKR as a unit. We never thought we were in the game. I think I don't need to talk much about individuals. We are lucky to have great players. Special mention to Ashwin for his delivery to Russell. And McCoy is an interesting guy.\"</div><div> </div><div><strong>Yuzvendra Chahal is the Player of the Match</strong></div><div> </div><div><strong>Yuzvendra Chahal:</strong> \"I had to take wickets in this match to change the result. I worked on my bowling. I spoke to the coaches and the skipper. I was thinking of a googly but then I didn't want to take a chance.

At the end of 20 overs, CSK managed to put up a total of 169. GT started off their batting by losing three of their crucial wickets in the powerplay and Miller in the middle steadied the ship.

Just that we wanted to take the game deep. We were trying to take the game as deep as possible. I haven't batted in the first 5 games, that was the discussion, so I wanted to take the responsibility. We wanted two batters to score big, I just had a discussion with Miller and we tried to strike the ball hard. I needed to step up and take the responsibility, just wanted to back myself and that was the plan.\"</span></div><div> </div><div><strong><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">David Miller is the player of the match</span></strong></div><div> </div><div><strong><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">David Miller:</span></strong><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">&nbsp;\"</span><span style=\"color:#222222\">I have been really working hard on my fitness. It was sort of playing my game, see ball hit ball, with the rate already quite high, I wanted to express myself. Getting in with the position at 16/3 gives me an opportunity to shine, doesn't happen too often but when the ball was new it helps. Releases a lot of pressure, needed someone to help out at the back end. In the first couple of games we got over the line with close wins, we could've probably lost 4 out of 6 rather than won 5 of 6. The dice rolled on our side and hopefully, it continues going forward.\"</span></div></div></div>",

Umran Malik was the pick of the bowlers, picking up 4 wickets and bowling a rare maiden over in the final over of the innings. In the chase, Tripathi and Abhishek Sharma steadied the innings after Punjab struck early and removed the SRH skipper, after which a 75* (50) run partnership between Pooran and Markram helped the Orange Army move into the Top 4 positions in the points table.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Shikhar Dhawan, Punjab Kings Captain:</strong></span> \"I felt we were 30-40 short, we lost too many early wickets and that hurt us.

Certainly, our attention is on the side in terms of the contributions that we want to make, the style of cricket that we want to play and so far there's been a lot of learning. Guys are enjoying their cricket as well and adjusting nicely. We know the challenges come thick and fast and we'll be looking forward to our next one. So far we've managed to put out some strong performances and we'll continue to try and improve and put out better ones.

My job is to frighten the batters with pace. I used to play tennis-ball cricket until 2018 and started practicing with the leather ball 3 years back. Abdul Samad, who used to practice with me, got me into the team as a net bowler. There are a lot of fast bowlers in our region, plenty of talented bowlers who can bowl at 130-140 kph.\"</p>",

RCB made up the highest total (189) this season at this venue. DC only managed to hit 173 at the end of 20 overs. David Warner was magnificent with the bat scoring 66 off 32 and Josh Hazelwood picked 3 wickets for 28 runs.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Rishabh Pant, Delhi Capitals Captain:</strong><span style=\"color:#222222\">&nbsp;\"I think Warner batted beautifully and gave us every chance to win the match. The wicket got better and better as the innings went along, that over from Mustafizur was a game changer for us. I think we could bowl according to our plans, but we were under the pump, the way DK batted in the later overs was commendable. We will have to talk about doing better as a team, we'll have to learn from our mistakes in the coming games.\"</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Faf Du Plessis, Royal Challengers Bangalore Captain:</strong><span style=\"color:#222222\">&nbsp;\"Batting again was a little tricky. But Maxi put the pressure back on them. The bowlers were fantastic today. Most teams can fall away quickly seeing so much of dew. But we stuck to our plans. Nice thing to have experience. Whether it is going well or not, you can reinforce the trust. DK is in the form of his life. Obviously lucky to have him in our side. Just one game at a time. It is important to stay calm and composed.\"</span></p><div> </div><div><strong>Dinesh Karthik is the Player of the Match</strong></div><div> </div><div><strong>Dinesh Karthik:</strong><span style=\"color:#222222\">&nbsp;\"</span><span style=\"color:#222222\">But I must admit that I have a bigger goal. I have been working really hard. I have been trying everything to be a part of the Indian team. I respected Kuldeep as he bowled well. When you are batting at the death, you try and get under the ball more while hitting. I must admit positions and calmness comes from preparations. Apart from that staying in the moment sounds cliched but it works.</span></div>",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of Match 26 in the TATA IPL, where the five-time champions Mumbai Indians take on the debutants Lucknow Super Giants at the Brabourne stadium in Mumbai. Mumbai are the only side yet to register a win and have lost each of their five matches. Lucknow, on the other hand, are one of the six teams on six points and will look to move into the Top 2 with a win today in what will be their skipper, <strong>KL Rahul's 100th game in the IPL</strong>.</p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Both sides will be playing their second match at Brabourne this season, with MI losing to DC, and LSG defeating CSK at the ground. It has been a high-scoring venue, with teams batting first posting 175+ totals in all games here so far. The average first innings score at the venue is 191, the highest among all venues. Teams batting second have won four of the six games so far. The venue has also seen the highest chase of the season (211 by LSG vs CSK).</p><p> </p><p>The venue has favored fast bowlers when it comes to wicket-taking, with 65% of the dismissals at the venue being taken by the fast bowlers.</p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings Scores in each phase:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) - 58/1</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) - 83/2</p><p>Death Overs (16-20) - 50/3<br /> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-</strong></p><p>Graeme Swann: \"This pitch was used in Match 2 between Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals. It's very good for batting and it's very hard. There is a bit of grass covering and we had good bounce in the last game. You get more value by bowling short. A very good track for batting and I'd be tempted to bat first.\"</p>",

After being put in to bat, the Lucknow skipper scored a century in his 100th IPL game, helping Lucknow post 199 on board. Mumbai were off to a blazing start after a quick-fire 31(13) from Brevis, but wickets in regular intervals from the Lucknow bowlers led by Avesh Khan helped them defend the total and get their fourth victory of the campaign.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Mumbai Indians Captain:</strong></span> \"Hard to point out one particular situation, when you are chasing a total we need big partnerships, something we failed to do today. They bat quite deep and it is important to hold your key bowlers towards the back end. We always try and keep Bumrah for the back end and it didn't seem to work out, he bowled pretty well but the others just need to pull up their socks a little bit. Every game we play is an opportunity, we try and think what our best playing XI, which is best suited for the particular conditions and particular team. We lost 6 games now, we are trying to understand what our right combination is, but it all depends on the opposition that we play. When you lose games it is very easy to point out that changes are being made but we try and go with our best eleven. I think KL batted brilliantly that is something missing from our team, wanted someone in our top four to bat as long as possible which is not happening, don't want to look too much into it. We haven't won a game yet but we need to keep our heads high. It's important to keep looking forward. It's not the end of the world, we have come back before and we will try and come back again.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>KL Rahul is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>KL Rahul, Lucknow Super Giants:</strong></span> \"Special day, special hundred, was a good pitch and wanted to make it count. We have defended really well, the bowlers have really come to the game, that's something we can take forward going ahead. At times, we have lost a couple of wickets and it's hard to come back, but we have done so at times, and that's something which bodes well going ahead. We have played good cricket, nothing to take away from the other teams, we need to keep our feet on the ground and stay humble, and keep learning. We're a new franchise, but we have a brilliant team, enjoy spending time with these guys. The team we have picked in the auction, we were clear we wanted good guys in the set-up, the owners have been supportive, the management has been good, it's a caring franchise, people are being looked after well, that's the kind of franchise we wanted to create. It's still early days in the tournament.\"</p>",

The Kane Williamson-led side bounced back after losses in their first two matches to win two on the trot. Kolkata meanwhile will be eager to get back to winning ways after losing their previous match at the same venue.</p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>Both teams have faced each other in 21 IPL matches, with KKR winning 14 and SRH winning 7.&nbsp;<br /> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>It has been a high-scoring venue, with teams batting first posting 175+ totals in all games here so far. The average first innings score at the venue is 194, and teams batting second have won three of the five games so far.</p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings Scores in each phase:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) - 62/1</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) - 83/3</p><p>Death Overs (16-20) - 49/3</p><p> </p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-</strong></p><p>Simon Doull: \"Looks like a magnificent surface. Lovely grass coverage on it, and really nice pace on offer. Good pace, good bounce. Batters have made the most of scoring runs in the early stages here. It's harder to score in the death overs. Dimensions - 68 metres on one side away to point - not a very big hit down there at all and over third man it is very small. But 81 metres to the leg-side and a huge hit out to cow corner (89 metres). Bat first, put runs on the board and if you get 185-190, you'll be okay. It's a really good surface. Don't worry about batting first.\"</p>",

After winning the toss and opting to field, the Hyderabad seamers picked up three wickets inside the Powerplay after which Rana and Russell joined hands to power Kolkata to 175 at the end of 20 overs. In the chase, Rahul Tripathi smashed 71 (37) against his former side and was supported by Markram, who scored his second half-century this season to help Sunrisers Hyderabad cross the finish line with 13 balls to spare.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer, Kolkata Knight Riders Captain:</strong></span> \"I thought it was a good total. Rahul Tripathi didn't allow us to settle down, credit to the pace with which they played. We put on a great batting effort to post 175. Was a bad day with the ball.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Kane Williamson, Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain:</strong></span> \"It was a step up again. It was important to take early wickets with the ball against KKR and the death bowling was great too. Rahul Tripathi was amazing and so was Aiden Markram, although in different roles. Marco, with his bounce and pace, was a big part of our attack with Bhuvneshwar, who swings the ball. It is just about getting the fields right for Malik. There are many little things we can work on, and the guys are working on them. We're seeing the improvement.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Rahul Tripathi is the Player of the Match.</strong></p><p><strong>Rahul Tripathi:</strong> \"I enjoyed myself today. The time with KKR was special, and now it is special with SRH as well. Russell bangs it in short if you are new, and I was looking for that shot if the ball was there. Varun bowls well, I didn't expect him to pitch it up and that's why I went through with that lofted shot. I have been struggling with my health over the last few days and the management did a very good job with me. There are days when things get tough, but I enjoy the hard work and the good days.\"</p>",

One side's 73m, the other is 70m - the dimensions are very similar. The pitch is an absolute beauty, it's got a fairly strong bit of grass in and around the hard lengths that the bowlers love to bowl on. It's very hard, it's got a little sheen to it, and don't expect it to be any different. 120 sixes have been scored at this ground in just eight games, that's extraordinary. 46% of the sixes have been downtown. This wicket is very good, it's got true, even pace. The quicks and the spinners got to be around those stumps, otherwise they are going to go the journey. Expect a lot of runs tonight, I think this is going to be a cracking game.\"</p>",

Mumbai have started their season with four losses whereas the Kings have won two and lost two. This will be a battle against the two pace attacks, which have the highest economies in the tournament.</p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>This fixture has seen numerous thrillers in the recent past, including the twin Super Over clash in 2020. Both teams have won three games each since 2019. <strong>Who will come out on top today?</strong></p><p><br /><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>The average score batting first in the venue is 173. 162 is the highest total that has been chased so far and teams have won twice while batting first and chasing.</p><p><strong>Average 1st Innings Scores in each phase:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) - 50/1</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) - 75/3</p><p>Death Overs (16-20) - 57/3</p><p><br /><strong>PITCH REPORT:-</strong></p><p>Deep Dasgupta: \"This is the fifth game at this venue and this is the first time we're playing on a used pitch. This was the pitch used for the first game that was played here. Being a center wicket, the dimensions are pretty equal on both sides. There is an even covering of grass today and&nbsp; toss might not prove to be a huge factor either.\"</p>",

After being put in to bat first, Punjab got off to a flyer, scoring 65 runs in the Powerplay. Fifties from the Punjab skipper and Shikhar Dhawan followed by late cameos from Jitesh Sharma and Shahrukh Khan helped Punjab post 198 on board. In the chase, Mumbai lost both their openers inside the Powerplay, but the two teenagers stitched on an 84 (41) partnership to help Mumbai keep up with the required run rate, after which Punjab was excellent at the death to restrict Mumbai and win by 12 runs.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Mumbai Indians Captain:</strong></span> \"Thought we played well, came pretty close to closing the game, a couple of run-outs didn't help our cause. At one time, we were cruising along but didn't hold our nerves, credit to PBKS for bowling well in the second half. We're trying to play with a different thought process, but it's not working out well. We aren't playing good cricket, we need to understand some situations and execute according to it. They got off to a flier and put our bowlers under pressure, but the pitch was good to bat on and I thought 198 was chaseable. As I said earlier, we need to go back to the drawing-room and come back better prepared.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Mayank Agarwal is the Player of the Match.</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Mayank Agarwal, Punjab Kings Captain:</strong></span> \"It was a good night, very happy to contribute to the team's win. The crucial thing for us was the two points. There were a lot of crucial moments and more often than not, we were nailing and winning those moments. When the game was 50-50, we won those moments and it came towards us. We want to play aggressive, hard cricket and show a good mindset. Very happy to have three wins and we are playing good cricket overall. If we continue to do that and improve 5-10% every game, we'll go on to do special things.\"</p>",

It is the Southern derby today, where the Chennai Super Kings face the Royal Challengers Bangalore at DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai. It hasn't been a pleasant beginning for CSK as they have lost their first four matches and are yet to get off the mark in the tournament, while for RCB, the fortune has changed this season under the captaincy of former CSK player Faf Du Plessis. RCB has won three out of their four games comfortably and is currently at number three in the points table. Will CSK score their first points today <strong>(on their 200th IPL match)</strong> or will RCB top the points table?</p><p> </p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>CSK and RCB have played on 28 occasions and CSK is way ahead of RCB in the tally.

This is going to spin. For the seam bowlers, there's not a great deal on this pitch. Batting first, if they can get 170-180, that's very defendable. The ground staff are treating the outfield again, so dew won't be as big a problem as it has been earlier on in the IPL.\"</span></div>",

That partnership speaks for itself. When you are chasing a big score you have to have a good start, we didn't have that tonight. Good bowling from Chennai, they used their spinners well on a pitch that had some grip.

I would like to dedicate this to my wife and also the team because the first victory is always special. Previous four games, we couldn't cross the line but as a team, we came good. Robbie and Shivam batted brilliantly. The bowlers contributed with the ball as well. Our management doesn't put pressure on me, they are relaxed, and they always come to me and motivate. As a captain, I am still picking the brains of our senior players. Mahi bhai is there, I always go to him and discuss. I am still learning and trying to get better with each game. We'll look to push hard in the tournament, we've got the momentum, we'll try and continue the momentum.\"</div><div> </div><div><div> </div><div><strong>Shivam Dube is the Player of the Match.</strong></div><div> </div><div><strong>Shivam Dube:</strong> \"We were looking for the first win and I am really happy that I contributed to the team. I am more focused this time and focusing on the basics. I tried to maintain my balance. As the situation demands, as the captain and coach tell me, I am ready to bat anywhere.\"</div></div>",

With 15 runs needed in the final over, the debutant Kuldeep Sen held his nerve and defended the team with 4 runs remaining!&nbsp;</p><div> </div><div><span style=\"color:#1abc9c\"><strong>KL Rahul, LSG captain:</strong></span><span style=\"color:#222222\">&nbsp;\"We have a good team, and have enough options with bat and ball. Even when we were 20-odd for three, we knew we had a chance. Obviously, today we needed one good partnership which we never got going. At the end, it was excellent from Stoinis to get it close and to do it in his first game of the season will give him confidence. We'll try to work harder and handle the pressure better. One bad game won't change things, will be a good learning for us.</span></div><div> </div><p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Sanju Samson, RR captain:</strong></span><span style=\"color:#222222\">&nbsp;\"Feels good to be at the top of the table. Depends on how he has bowled his first three overs. Got the feel that Kuldeep has done well and he is confident to go and execute his wide yorker which he has been working in the offseason. Chahal is someone who can be given the ball anytime from overs 1-20. He's the greatest legspinner if I can say, that India's seen in the present. Thought why not use him more at the end when the pressure is more.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Yuzvendra Chahal is the player of the match</strong></p><p><strong>Yuzvendra Chahal<span style=\"color:#222222\">: </span></strong><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">\"I've been bowling well always, in the middle I had a bad patch, but my main strength is my mind and I didn't want to divert from that. I am ready to bowl any time. I thought to protect runs so that it will be useful later. My favorite wicket was de Kock's dismissal since he is a gamechanger.\"&nbsp;</span></p><p> </p>",

This will be Ravindra Jadeja's 150th T20 match for the Super Kings, becoming the third player after MSD and Raina to reach this landmark for the franchise.

There's a lot of grass on this pitch and there's been a lot of moisture put on this ground by the ground staff. The wicket will not be quick, will be fairly easy-paced. The spin bowlers could quite enjoy this wicket, there might be a bit of turn in offer. Not a high-scoring venue today, 150-160 will be a good score for the side batting first.\"</p><div> </div>",

Punjab on the other hand, have begun this season with two wins in three games and already have the experience of playing at this venue, winning their previous match over here.</p><p> </p><p>This match could very well be decided in the Powerplay, as <strong>Punjab has three out of the four highest PowerPlay</strong> scores so far and will look to continue their onslaught in this phase, whereas the <strong>Titans have taken 7 wickets in the Powerplay so far in the competition.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>The average score at this venue is 181 in this IPL so far, the highest of all venues and 83% of the scores in this venue this IPL have been above 175.&nbsp;Both the night games at the venue have been won by the chasing side. Will we see another high-scoring thriller tonight?<br /><br /><strong>Average 1st Innings Scores in each phase:-</strong></p><p>Powerplay (1-6 Ov) - 66/1</p><p>Middle Overs (7-15 Ov) - 68/3</p><p>Death Overs (16-20) - 55/3</p><p><br /><strong>PITCH REPORT:-</strong></p><p>Matthew Hayden: \"We can expect another high-scoring game. We've got a little bit of grass on this wicket which is going to be very consistent. Lots of even pace and bounce and a very good wicket. The middle-overs could be a struggle for both teams. I think it's going to be plenty of runs.\"</p>",

GT won the toss and decided to bowl first. PBKS scored 189 at the end of 20 overs with the help of a blistering knock from Livingstone(64 off 27) and from some quick cameos from Jitesh Sharma and Rahul Chahar! Gujarat Titans opened their batting positively. Shubman Gill made an amazing (96 off 59), and Rahul Tewatia in the end finished the match with two consecutive sixes when 12 runs were demanded in the last two deliveries!</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Mayank Agarwal, PBKS Captian:</span>&nbsp;\"It was a tough game but we really fought hard. There were a lot of positives for us. We did really well to get ourselves to that score after losing so many wickets, so we were very happy with that. Last over could have been anyone's game. We totally back Odean, it's fine, he probably had a hard game but that's fine. It's just a game of cricket, it could be a bitter one to swallow but it's fine.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Hardik Pandya, GT captain:</span> Hats off to Tewatia. It is difficult to go out there and hit, and to do it under this pressure is great. It was Kings' game, I have sympathy for them. Gill is telling everybody that he is there. A lot of credit goes to Sai as well for that partnership. It kept us in the game.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Shubman Gill is the Player of the Match:</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Shubman Gill:</strong> It is important to keep the scoreboard ticking. It is important to hit those gaps because this outfield is rapid. It is just about execution. It was just one of those days where I was hitting the ball well and finding the gaps as well. As an opener, I have to bat through the innings, so that it is easier for the big-hitters to hit it in the end. Instead of not thinking in the nets, I try and work and reduce my dot balls as much as possible.</p><p> </p>",

After being put in to bat Delhi got off to a flyer scoring 67 runs for the first wicket, headlined by a quickfire fifty from Prithvi Shaw, after which the Lucknow bowlers put the brakes and restricted Delhi to 149/3, conceding just 76 runs in the last 10 overs. In the second innings, Quinton De Kock set up the chase, scoring 80 off 52 balls and a late cameo from Krunal Pandya and Ayush Badoni helped Lucknow get across the line.</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Rishabh Pant, Delhi Capitals Captain:</strong></span> \"As a batting unit we were 10-15 short and at the end Avesh and Holder pulled it back brilliantly, credit to them. We were talking about giving 100% till the last ball, no matter what happens. The powerplay was fine, we didn't get any wicket, our spin attack did well in the middle overs but in the end, we were 10-15 short.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>KL Rahul, Lucknow Super Giants Captain:</strong></span> \"I think we were brilliant with the ball. In the powerplay, we obviously need to go back and work on but that's how powerplays go sometimes. We assessed things well after that and bowled better. Obviously, would have loved the bowlers to assess things a bit earlier, but it was nice to see them discuss the lines, lengths, and pace to bowl after the powerplay. Ayush Badoni has held his nerve every time he has gone into bat and he's delivered for us under pressure. Great learning for him, important for him to keep working hard and stay humble. Been a complete team effort so far. The way everyone has stepped up has been brilliant.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Quinton de Kock is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p><strong>Quinton De Kock:</strong> \"It was a matter of just playing what's in front of you, reacting to it. It was a chaseable score. You want a decent start in the powerplay and we didn't want to get too ahead in the chase, was important to keep wickets in hand. If we were chasing 180, might have been difficult but thanks to our bowlers.\"</p>",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of Match 14 in the TATA IPL 2023. Kolkata Knight Riders takes on Mumbai Indians today at Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Pune. It is KKR's fourth match and MI's third one. KKR has won the previous encounter against PBKS, and MI has lost both the games they played this season. MI would be happy in welcoming their star batter Suryakumar Yadav and KKR welcomes Pat Cummins to this match.&nbsp;<strong>It is the only venue in which the chasing side has lost the two games which were played here.</strong></p>",

KKR won the toss and put MI to bat first. MI started off the innings slowly and accelerated very well in the death overs, thanks to the innings of Suryakumar Yadav (52 off 36) and Pollard (22* off 5). KKR entered the pitch with a target of 162 to chase. Venkatesh Iyer (50* off 41) held one end tightly even after fall of wickets and the final fireworks of Pat Cummins (56* off 15) led the team to victory in the 16th over.</strong></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, MI Captain:</strong></span><span style=\"color:#222222\">&nbsp;Never expected him to come and play like that [on Cummins]. With the bat we did not start well, in the last 4-5 overs to get 70+ was a great effort from the batting unit. We did not bowl according to the plan. We had the game till the 15th over, but then Cummins was brilliant. This will be hard to digest, the way it turned out in the last few overs. We have a lot of hard work ahead of us.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer, KKR Captain:</strong></span><span style=\"color:#222222\">&nbsp;Extraordinary! I couldn't believe the way he (Cummins) was hitting the ball. During the timeout, the plan was for Venky to drop anchor and tell Pat to just swing at everything because that's what he was doing before too.&nbsp; We have to take responsibility as top-order batters. All of us have the ability to hit the ball long. In the powerplay in both innings, the pitch was quite the same. After the powerplay, it got a lot easier I guess.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Pat Cummins is the player of the match!</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Pat Cummins | Player of the Match: I probably think I'm most surprised by that innings. I'm glad that it came off. I was thinking of having a swing if it was in my area. Wasn't trying to overthink it. Very satisfying to do it on my first game this season. Was just trying to pepper the shorter boundary. The hard thing after a big auction is that there are a lot of changes from last year. It's a good mix of talent out there and quite relaxed with the boys.</strong></p><p> </p>",

This is the 13th match and the third to be held at Wankhede stadium where the average score lies below 150 this season. RR is at the top of the table with two wins in the two games whereas RCB has lost the first game and has won the previous encounter.

RCB won the toss and forced RR to bat first. RR made a slow and steady start in the beginning and they finished with the score of 169 on a high note with Jos Buttler scoring 70* runs of it. RCB opened their batting well without losing any wickets in the powerplay and the finishers Shabaz Ahmed (45 off 26) and Dinesh Karthik (44* off 23) wrapped up the match with 5 balls remaining.</p><p><span style=\"color:#9b59b6\"><strong>Sanju Samson, RR Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"I can't point out one moment where we lost the game. I thought it was a great effort to put up that total on such a slow wicket after losing the toss. Jos and Hetmyer batted brilliantly at the death. Taking the match to the last over with the dew coming in was a great effort as well. Lot of positives to take out of this loss, and we can learn a lot of things as well.\"</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Faf du Plessis, RCB Captain:</strong></span> \"To pull it out of nowhere, you need some great characters and DK is as great a character as you can get. His composure under pressure is amazing. We bowled really well, upto the 18th over and then Jos got some good shots. Got a score which we thought was a bit above-par with the conditions and the surface spinning a bit. We started quite well though, but then Yuzi (Chahal) bowled really well to get them back in. But for me, the great thing about today once again was our ability to come back to win games out of nowhere.\"</p><p><strong>Dinesh Karthik is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p><strong>Dinesh Karthik, Player of the Match: </strong>\"I think I made a conscious effort this year to do justice to myself because the last year, I felt I could have done better. The way I trained was much better this time around. I'm making a conscious effort to tell myself that I'm not done yet. When I went in, we needed 12 rpo and had to keep going. I train for these situations. To stay calm and know whom you can take down.\"&nbsp;</p>",

After being put to bat first, the Lucknow skipper led the team from the front scoring 68 runs, supported by Deepak Hooda who also scored fifty, helping Lucknow score 169 at the end of 20 overs. In the chase, SRH started off their innings slowly and a fine knock from Tripathi and Pooran bought the team closer to the target, but they couldn't get across the line thanks to a brilliant performance with the ball by Avesh Khan, who got his best figures of 4/24 in the IPL, helping the team register their second win in the tournament!</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Kane Williamson, Sunrisers Hyderabad Captain:</strong></span> \"If you look at the performance, it was certainly much improved from our first outing. The start with the ball was outstanding. We were in a strong position and credit to Hooda and Rahul for pulling things back. I suppose with the bat there were glimpses. It was close but not close enough. The guys with the roles they have with the ball were outstanding. It's small margins. A few ones and a few twos and the chase takes quite a different shape.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>KL Rahul, Lucknow Super Giants Captain:</strong></span> \"What's been pleasing is that we have always found a way to stay in the game and give ourselves a chance to win, we did that again today. Not ideal to lose three wickets in the first four overs, it's not something that'll bring us down, that's something we need to learn as a batting group how we can play risk-free cricket. With the ball, we have been brilliant in all three games and that's something we need to carry ahead.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Avesh Khan is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p>Avesh Khan: \"The plan always is how I can pick up wickets in the Powerplay and slog overs. The plan is to always bowl dots and try to hit the yorker length. I always get a lot of support from the captain and support staff, and want to bowl with the same rhythm.\"</p>",

For the first time in their IPL history, the Yellow Army have started their campaign with consecutive defeats. Punjab on the other hand got off to a flyer, chasing 206 against RCB, and had lost their previous game against Kolkata. While Chennai will be eager to get off the mark, Punjab will aim to get back on track. <strong>This will be Mayank Agarwal's 50th game for the franchise and MSD's 350th T20 game.</strong></p><p><strong>The chasing side has won all the last five encounters in CSK-PBKS matches in the IPL. Is it advantage Chennai after the toss?</strong></p>",

We could have batted well, especially in the middle overs we lost three wickets in the powerplay and three in the middle. I think every match is going to be hard after losing so many wickets. When you lose you feel heartbroken but at the end of the day if you keep improving and have a better environment then people can perform in the next match.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Gujarat Titans Captain:</strong></span> \"Really happy with the way boys are coming out and contributing. The kind of attack we have, we always felt that we can make a score that's 10 under-par look like 25 above. I thought there were periods where Delhi was ahead, but then that Lockie over really changed things for us. We were one bowler short with Aaron's injury, had to take it as deep as possible and it worked for us. Till Rishabh was there, the game was in the balance or maybe Delhi was ahead, and that over from Lockie really turned it for us.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Lockie Ferguson is the Player of the Match.</strong></p><p><strong>Lockie Ferguson:</strong> \"Was one of those nights and with the kind of bowling partners I have, makes things very easy for me. It's great to have a potent bowling unit and helps to spread calmness in the group. The pressure was coming from both ends with the ball and it worked for us. I think bowling extra fast is more of an instinct thing. There was a lot of bounce in the surface and I was looking to bang away on that hard length. Hardik is always giving us confidence to play the game that we want to play and it's nice to have a captain who trusts your skills.\"</p>",

KKR won the toss and forced Punjab to bat first. Umesh Yadav provided an early breakthrough in the very first over and went on to take 4/23 at the end of the innings. Punjab Kings were all-out before their complete quota for a score of 137 runs. After a nervous start from the KKR top-order, Russell took over the show and rained sixers frequently. His volcanic innings led the team to the victory in the 15th over!</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Mayank Agarwal, Punjab Kings Captain:</strong></span> \"We didn't bat well enough. We showed some real fight with the ball initially and then Dre Russ came in and got going, credit to him for taking the game away from us like that. We started off well but could not capitalize, there were a few soft dismissals. The bowlers pulled it back nicely for us and we were in the game initially, but Russell took the game away. There were a lot of positives to take away.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer, Kolkata Knight Riders Captain:</strong></span> \"We were stunned by Punjab's approach, we didn't expect them to come so hard at us in the initial overs after losing an early wicket. My plan was to keep my best bowlers for their hard-hitters and that's why I kept Varun and Sunil for late. They made my job easy and came out with their own strategies. They know what their plans are for the batsmen. To be honest, it was great to see Russell hitting, it was Russell Muscle. Umesh told me that he was getting older, but I told him that he was getting fitter. I see him wherever I go, at the gym, and he is working very hard. I know how to get the work done from him, and he has been a wonderful colleague.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Umesh Yadav is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p><strong>Umesh Yadav:</strong> \"I need to work hard. Getting older and when you know you play just one format, I look to bowl as much as possible. When someone improves at practice, they do well during the match as well. I didn't think Mayank would charge at me on his first ball, he has played me a lot in the nets. I knew he would play off the back foot, and that's where I looked to bowl on a fuller length. Whatever is happening now, has been because of what I have practiced with my coaches. If you bowl at 140kph, you need to be accurate and you need to bowl at the stumps.\"</p>",

While this is the debut IPL season for LSG, their opponents CSK are one of the most successful teams in the history of the tournament. Both the teams had begun this IPL season with a loss at the Wankhede Stadium. The good news for the four-time champions is that they have already welcomed English all-rounder Moeen Ali, who missed the first game due to a delayed visa. So, on Thursday, they would be eager to turn their fortunes around in Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium, while the Super Giants would look forward to opening their account for the first time.</p>",

With the toss being won by the Titans, the team decided to bowl first and struck early inside the powerplay courtesy of Shami, and he ended the match with figures of 3/25. Fifties from Deepak Hooda and the young Ayush Badoni helped Lucknow stage a comeback and post a fighting total on board. The KL-Rahul led side continued their momentum and struck twice within the powerplay, putting the brakes on Gujarat's chase. However late cameos from Rahul Tewatia and David Miller helped Gujarat score 68 in the last five overs to emerge victorious!</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#1abc9c\"><strong>KL Rahul, Lucknow Super Giants Captain:</strong></span> \"It was a phenomenal game to start the campaign. Starting off like that with the bat was not ideal but the way we recovered was phenomenal. It gives us so much confidence when the batters in the middle and lower order can do the job. There is so much to take away and learn for us. With the way we finished and batted in the second half we gave ourselves a chance. Good win for them and good learning for us.\"</p><p> </p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Gujarat Titans Captain:</strong></span> \"This was the right game for us to be on either side and learn, but have learnt a lot by winning. Shami is known for his seam positions and he got us to a great start. We would have any day taken 160 on this wicket. Mostly I'll bat at number four, because I want to take pressure with my experience so that the others can play freely. Manohar is some talent and he is someone who you are going to hear about in the future. Tewatia was sensational as well. Getting out to Krunal would have pinched me more had we lost, but now the family is neutral and happy. He got me out and we won the match.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Mohammad Shami is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p><strong>Mohammad Shami:</strong> \"I was warmed up well. It was important to get a good start in the first match, I looked to bowl a Test-match line and length here. I have worked very hard on this seam position. I try to come round the wicket to a leftie and make that angle because that's the most uncomfortable thing for them. Hardik asked me if I wanted the fourth over on the trot, but I told him to hold me back.\"</p>",

There was a bit of dew out there, a tough night for the bowlers, but I thought they were pretty decent with the wet ball. Small margins, but Punjab chased it down really well. The ball skidded on a bit more in the second innings and then we pulled it back beautifully. We did a lot of good things in the middle but you know what Odean Smith can do to you.\"<br /><br /><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Mayank Agarwal, Punjab Kings Captain:</strong></span> \"Two points for us is very important. Very good wicket as both sides scored 200+, one or two balls held up but nothing apart from that. Credit to the way we finished, we took the right chances and am glad it came off. Virat and Faf took the game away from us but credit to our batters to chase this down. We trust our skills. If it doesn't come off, it doesn't come off but we are not going to panic and make a scene out of it.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Odean Smith is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p><strong>Odean Smith:</strong> \"We were stressing on having a good start, and we just needed to have that belief. Didn't go so well with the bowling, I need to work on a few things. Batting was good as I helped my team to win. Punjab hasn't won the title so far but we need to have the belief. We watched the movie '14 peaks', and 13 remain for us.\"</p>",

Having chosen to field, Kuldeep Yadav struck thrice, after which a blistering knock from Ishan Kishan helped Mumbai put 177/5 on board.

We knew we didn't have a lot of manpower with Mitch Marsh and Warner not here but we just wanted to make use of whatever we had. It is one of the best spells of Kuldeep in a long time, he was just giving it his everything in the nets and at practice. It is important to not be complacent after just one match.\"</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Mumbai Indians Captain:</strong></span> \"I thought it was a good score, it didn't look like a pitch where you can get 170+ at the start but we played in the middle and finished well. Just didn't bowl according to our plans. Things didn't go according to plan but that can happen, we just need to stay close as a group and take the learnings. Disappointed with the loss but not the end.\"</p><p><strong>Kuldeep Yadav is the Player of the Match.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Kuldeep Yadav:</strong> \"It was a difficult time for me, I was out with injury for five months. It was important for me to go for the rehab and thanks to the facilities and trainers at the NCA, I recovered very well and in time to get back into the Indian setup, and slowly I started match preparation and when I started playing the games, I got the confidence and Rohit motivated me a lot. Whatever changes need to be done, I had that communication with him, and here in the Delhi set up I spoke to Ricky Ponting and he backed me a lot. I was lacking rhythm for a long time and I worked on my rhythm a lot and never compromised on turning the ball despite the variation in pace.\"</p>",

Mumbai is one place I love to play as I grew up here. I thought the wicket would be flat but it was pretty easy for me with the bowling lineup I had. Umesh has worked hard in the nets and did well in the practice games too.
